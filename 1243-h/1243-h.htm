<h2>SOME THOUGHTS OF A READER OF TENNYSON</h2>
<p>Fifty years after Tennyson&rsquo;s birth he was saluted a great poet
by that unanimous acclamation which includes mere clamour.&nbsp; Fifty
further years, and his centenary was marked by a new detraction.&nbsp;
It is sometimes difficult to distinguish the obscure but not unmajestic
law of change from the sorry custom of reaction.&nbsp; Change hastes
not and rests not, reaction beats to and fro, flickering about the moving
mind of the world.&nbsp; Reaction&mdash;the paltry precipitancy of the
multitude&mdash;rather than the novelty of change, has brought about
a ferment and corruption of opinion on Tennyson&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp;
It may be said that opinion is the same now as it was in the middle
of the nineteenth century&mdash;the same, but turned.&nbsp; All that
was not worth having of admiration then has soured into detraction now.&nbsp;
It is of no more significance, acrid, than it was, sweet.&nbsp; What
the herding of opinion gave yesterday it is able to take away to-day,
that and no more.</p>
<p>But besides the common favour-disfavour of the day, there is the
tendency of educated opinion, once disposed to accept the whole of Tennyson&rsquo;s
poetry as though he could not be &ldquo;parted from himself,&rdquo;
and now disposed to reject the whole, on the same plea.&nbsp; But if
ever there was a poet who needed to be thus &ldquo;parted&rdquo;&mdash;the
word is his own&mdash;it is he who wrote both narrowly for his time
and liberally for all time, and who&mdash;this is the more important
character of his poetry&mdash;had both a style and a manner: a masterly
style, a magical style, a too dainty manner, nearly a trick; a noble
landscape and in it figures something ready-made.&nbsp; He is a subject
for our alternatives of feeling, nay, our conflicts, as is hardly another
poet.&nbsp; We may deeply admire and wonder, and, in another line or
hemistich, grow indifferent or slightly averse.&nbsp; He sheds the luminous
suns of dreams upon men &amp; women who would do well with footlights;
waters their way with rushing streams of Paradise and cataracts from
visionary hills; laps them in divine darkness; leads them into those
touching landscapes, &ldquo;the lovely that are not beloved;&rdquo;
long grey fields, cool sombre summers, and meadows thronged with unnoticeable
flowers; speeds his carpet knight&mdash;or is that hardly a just name
for one whose sword &ldquo;smites&rdquo; so well?&mdash;upon a carpet
of authentic wild flowers; pushes his rovers, in costume, from off blossoming
shores, on the keels of old romance.&nbsp; The style and the manner,
I have said, run side by side.&nbsp; If we may take one poet&rsquo;s
too violent phrase, and consider poets to be &ldquo;damned to poetry,&rdquo;
why, then, Tennyson is condemned by a couple of sentences, &ldquo;to
run concurrently.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have the style and the manner locked
together at times in a single stanza, locked and yet not mingled.&nbsp;
There should be no danger for the more judicious reader lest impatience
at the peculiar Tennyson trick should involve the great Tennyson style
in a sweep of protest.&nbsp; Yet the danger has in fact proved real
within the present and recent years, and seems about to threaten still
more among the less judicious.&nbsp; But it will not long prevail.&nbsp;
The vigorous little nation of lovers of poetry, alive one by one within
the vague multitude of the nation of England, cannot remain finally
insensible to what is at once majestic and magical in Tennyson.&nbsp;
For those are not qualities they neglect in their other masters.&nbsp;
How, valuing singleness of heart in the sixteenth century, splendour
in the seventeenth, composure in the eighteenth; how, with a spiritual
ear for the note&mdash;commonly called Celtic, albeit it is the most
English thing in the world&mdash;the wild wood note of the remoter song;
how, with the educated sense of style, the liberal sense of ease; how,
in a word, fostering Letters and loving Nature, shall that choice nation
within England long disregard these virtues in the nineteenth-century
master?&nbsp; How disregard him, for more than the few years of reaction,
for the insignificant reasons of his bygone taste, his insipid courtliness,
his prettiness, or what not?&nbsp; It is no dishonour to Tennyson, for
it is a dishonour to our education, to disparage a poet who wrote but
the two&mdash;had he written no more of their kind&mdash;lines of &ldquo;The
Passing of Arthur,&rdquo; of which, before I quote them, I will permit
myself the personal remembrance of a great contemporary author&rsquo;s
opinion.&nbsp; Mr. Meredith, speaking to me of the high-water mark of
English style in poetry and prose, cited those lines as topmost in poetry:-</p>
<blockquote><p>On one side lay the ocean, and on one<br />
Lay a great water, and the moon was full.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is no taint of manner, no pretty posture or habit, but the simplicity
of poetry and the simplicity of Nature, something on the yonder side
of imagery.&nbsp; It is to be noted that this noble passage is from
Tennyson&rsquo;s generally weakest kind of work&mdash;blank verse; and
should thus be a sign that the laxity of so many parts of the &ldquo;Idylls&rdquo;
and other blank verse poems was a quite unnecessary fault.&nbsp; Lax
this form of poetry undoubtedly is with Tennyson.&nbsp; His blank verse
is often too easy; it cannot be said to fly, for the paradoxical reason
that it has no weight; it slips by, without halting or tripping indeed,
but also without the friction of the movement of vitality.&nbsp; This
quality, which is so near to a fault, this quality of ease, has come
to be disregarded in our day.&nbsp; That Horace Walpole overpraised
this virtue is not good reason that we should hold it for a vice.&nbsp;
Yet we do more than undervalue it; and several of our authors, in prose
and poetry, seem to find much merit in the manifest difficulty; they
will not have a key to turn, though closely and tightly, in oiled wards;
let the reluctant iron catch and grind, or they would even prefer to
pick you the lock.</p>
<p>But though we may think it time that the quality once over-prized
should be restored to a more proportionate honour, our great poet Tennyson
shows us that of all merits ease is, unexpectedly enough, the most dangerous.&nbsp;
It is not only, with him, that the wards are oiled, it is also that
the key turns loosely.&nbsp; This is true of much of the beautiful &ldquo;Idylls,&rdquo;
but not of their best passages, nor of such magnificent heroic verse
as that of the close of &ldquo;A Vision of Sin,&rdquo; or of &ldquo;Lucretius.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As to the question of ease, we cannot have a better maxim than Coventry
Patmore&rsquo;s saying that poetry &ldquo;should confess, but not suffer
from, its difficulties.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we could hardly find a more
curious example of the present love of verse that not only confesses
but brags of difficulties, and not only suffers from them but cries
out under the suffering, and shows us the grimace of the pain of it,
than I have lighted upon in the critical article of a recent quarterly.&nbsp;
Reviewing the book of a &ldquo;poet&rdquo; who manifestly has an insuperable
difficulty in hacking his work into ten-syllable blocks, and keeping
at the same time any show of respect for the national grammar, the critic
gravely invites his reader to &ldquo;note&rdquo; the phrase &ldquo;neath
cliffs&rdquo; (apparently for &ldquo;beneath the cliffs&rdquo;) as &ldquo;characteristic.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Shall the reader indeed &ldquo;note&rdquo; such a matter?&nbsp; Truly
he has other things to do.&nbsp; This is by the way.&nbsp; Tennyson
is always an artist, and the finish of his work is one of the principal
notes of his versification.&nbsp; How this finish comports with the
excessive ease of his prosody remains his own peculiar secret.&nbsp;
Ease, in him, does not mean that he has any unhandsome slovenly ways.&nbsp;
On the contrary, he resembles rather the warrior with the pouncet box.&nbsp;
It is the man of &ldquo;neath cliffs&rdquo; who will not be at the trouble
of making a place for so much as a definite article.&nbsp; Tennyson
certainly <i>worked</i>, and the exceeding ease of his blank verse comes
perhaps of this little paradox&mdash;that he makes somewhat too much
show of the hiding of his art.</p>
<p>In the first place the poet with the great welcome style and the
little unwelcome manner, Tennyson is, in the second place, the modern
poet who withstood France.&nbsp; (That is, of course, modern France&mdash;France
since the Renaissance.&nbsp; From medieval Provence there is not an
English poet who does not own inheritance.)&nbsp; It was some time about
the date of the Restoration that modern France began to be modish in
England.&nbsp; A ruffle at the Court of Charles, a couplet in the ear
of Pope, a <i>tour</i> <i>de</i> <i>phrase</i> from Mme. de S&eacute;vign&eacute;
much to the taste of Walpole, later the good example of French painting&mdash;rich
interest paid for the loan of our Constable&rsquo;s initiative&mdash;later
still a scattering of French taste, French critical business, over all
the shallow places of our literature&mdash;these have all been phases
of a national vanity of ours, an eager and anxious fluttering or jostling
to be foremost and French.&nbsp; Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s essay on criticism
fostered this anxiety, and yet I find in this work of his a lack of
easy French knowledge, such as his misunderstanding of the word <i>brutalit&eacute;</i>,
which means no more, or little more, than roughness.&nbsp; Matthew Arnold,
by the way, knew so little of the French character as to be altogether
ignorant of French provincialism, French practical sense, and French
&ldquo;convenience.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Convenience&rdquo; is his dearest
word of contempt, &ldquo;practical sense&rdquo; his next dearest, and
he throws them a score of times in the teeth of the English.&nbsp; Strange
is the irony of the truth.&nbsp; For he bestows those withering words
on the nation that has the fifty religions, and attributes &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;&mdash;as
the antithesis of &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; and &ldquo;practical sense&rdquo;&mdash;to
the nation that has the fifty sauces.&nbsp; And not for a moment does
he suspect himself of this blunder, so manifest as to be disconcerting
to his reader.&nbsp; One seems to hear an incurably English accent in
all this, which indeed is reported, by his acquaintance, of Matthew
Arnold&rsquo;s actual speaking of French.&nbsp; It is certain that he
has not the interest of familiarity with the language, but only the
interest of strangeness.&nbsp; Now, while we meet the effect of the
French coat in our seventeenth century, of the French light verse in
our earlier eighteenth century, and of French philosophy in our later,
of the French revolution in our Wordsworth, of the French painting in
our nineteenth-century studios, of French fiction&mdash;and the dregs
are still running&mdash;in our libraries, of French poetry in our Swinburne,
of French criticism in our Arnold, Tennyson shows the effect of nothing
French whatever.&nbsp; Not the Elizabethans, not Shakespeare, not Jeremy
Taylor, not Milton, not Shelley were (in their art, not in their matter)
more insular in their time.&nbsp; France, by the way, has more than
appreciated the homage of Tennyson&rsquo;s contemporaries; Victor Hugo
avers, in <i>Les</i> <i>Mis&eacute;rables</i>, that our people imitate
his people in all things, and in particular he rouses in us a delighted
laughter of surprise by asserting that the London street-boy imitates
the Parisian street-boy.&nbsp; There is, in fact, something of a street-boy
in some of our late more literary mimicries.</p>
<p>We are apt to judge a poet too exclusively by his imagery.&nbsp;
Tennyson is hardly a great master of imagery.&nbsp; He has more imagination
than imagery.&nbsp; He sees the thing, with so luminous a mind&rsquo;s
eye, that it is sufficient to him; he needs not to see it more beautifully
by a similitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;A clear-walled city&rdquo; is enough;
&ldquo;meadows&rdquo; are enough&mdash;indeed Tennyson reigns for ever
over all meadows; &ldquo;the happy birds that change their sky&rdquo;;
&ldquo;Bright Phosphor, fresher for the night&rdquo;; &ldquo;Twilight
and evening bell&rdquo;; &ldquo;the stillness of the central sea&rdquo;;
&ldquo;that friend of mine who lives in God&rdquo;; &ldquo;the solitary
morning&rdquo;; &ldquo;Four grey walls and four grey towers&rdquo;;
&ldquo;Watched by weeping queens&rdquo;; these are enough, illustrious,
and needing not illustration.</p>
<p>If we do not see Tennyson to be the lonely, the first, the <i>one</i>
that he is, this is because of the throng of his following, though a
number that are of that throng hardly know, or else would deny, their
flocking.&nbsp; But he added to our literature not only in the way of
cumulation, but by the advent of his single genius.&nbsp; He is one
of the few fountain-head poets of the world.&nbsp; The new landscape
which was his&mdash;the lovely unbeloved&mdash;is, it need hardly be
said, the matter of his poetry and not its inspiration.&nbsp; It may
have seemed to some readers that it is the novelty, in poetry, of this
homely unscenic scenery&mdash;this Lincolnshire quality&mdash;that accounts
for Tennyson&rsquo;s freshness of vision.&nbsp; But it is not so.&nbsp;
Tennyson is fresh also in scenic scenery; he is fresh with the things
that others have outworn; mountains, desert islands, castles, elves,
what you will that is conventional.&nbsp; Where are there more divinely
poetic lines than those, which will never be wearied with quotation,
beginning, &ldquo;A splendour falls&rdquo;?&nbsp; What castle walls
have stood in such a light of old romance, where in all poetry is there
a sound wilder than that of those faint &ldquo;horns of elfland&rdquo;?&nbsp;
Here is the remoteness, the beyond, the light delirium, not of disease
but of more rapturous and delicate health, the closer secret of poetry.&nbsp;
This most English of modern poets has been taunted with his mere gardens.&nbsp;
He loved, indeed, the &ldquo;lazy lilies,&rdquo; of the exquisite garden
of &ldquo;The Gardener&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; but he betook his ecstatic
English spirit also far afield and overseas; to the winter places of
his familiar nightingale:-</p>
<blockquote><p>When first the liquid note beloved of men<br />
Comes flying over many a windy wave;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to the lotus-eaters&rsquo; shore; to the outland landscapes of &ldquo;The
Palace of Art&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;clear-walled city by the sea,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;pillared town,&rdquo; the &ldquo;full-fed river&rdquo;; to
the &ldquo;pencilled valleys&rdquo; of Monte Rosa; to the &ldquo;vale
in Ida&rdquo;; to that tremendous upland in the &ldquo;Vision of Sin&rdquo;:-</p>
<blockquote><p>At last I heard a voice upon the slope<br />
Cry to the summit, Is there any hope?<br />
To which an answer pealed from that high land,<br />
But in a tongue no man could understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cleopatra of &ldquo;The Dream of Fair Women&rdquo; is but a ready-made
Cleopatra, but when in the shades of her forest she remembers the sun
of the world, she leaves the page of Tennyson&rsquo;s poorest manner
and becomes one with Shakespeare&rsquo;s queen:-</p>
<blockquote><p>We drank the Libyan sun to sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nay, there is never a passage of manner but a great passage of style
rebukes our dislike and recalls our heart again.&nbsp; The dramas, less
than the lyrics, and even less than the &ldquo;Idylls,&rdquo; are matter
for the true Tennysonian.&nbsp; Their action is, at its liveliest rather
vivacious than vital, and the sentiment, whether in &ldquo;Becket&rdquo;
or in &ldquo;Harold,&rdquo; is not only modern, it is fixed within Tennyson&rsquo;s
own peculiar score or so of years.&nbsp; But that he might have answered,
in drama, to a stronger stimulus, a sharper spur, than his time administered,
may be guessed from a few passages of &ldquo;Queen Mary,&rdquo; and
from the dramatic terror of the arrow in &ldquo;Harold.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The line has appeared in prophetic fragments in earlier scenes, and
at the moment of doom it is the outcry of unquestionable tragedy:-</p>
<blockquote><p>Sanguelac&mdash;Sanguelac&mdash;the arrow&mdash;the arrow!&mdash;Away!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tennyson is also an eminently all-intelligible poet.&nbsp; Those
whom he puzzles or confounds must be a flock with an incalculable liability
to go wide of any road&mdash;&ldquo;down all manner of streets,&rdquo;
as the desperate drover cries in the anecdote.&nbsp; But what are streets,
however various, to the ways of error that a great flock will take in
open country&mdash;minutely, individually wrong, making mistakes upon
hardly perceptible occasions, or none&mdash;&ldquo;minute fortuitous
variations in any possible direction,&rdquo; as used to be said in exposition
of the Darwinian theory?&nbsp; A vast outlying public, like that of
Tennyson, may make you as many blunders as it has heads; but the accurate
clear poet proved his meaning to all accurate perceptions.&nbsp; Where
he hesitates, his is the sincere pause of process and uncertainty.&nbsp;
It has been said that Tennyson, midway between the student of material
science and the mystic, wrote and thought according to an age that wavered,
with him, between the two minds, and that men have now taken one way
or the other.&nbsp; Is this indeed true, and are men so divided and
so sure?&nbsp; Or have they not rather already turned, in numbers, back
to the parting, or meeting, of eternal roads?&nbsp; The religious question
that arises upon experience of death has never been asked with more
sincerity and attention than by him.&nbsp; If &ldquo;In Memoriam&rdquo;
represents the mind of yesterday it represents no less the mind of to-morrow.&nbsp;
It is true that pessimism and insurrection in their ignobler forms&mdash;nay,
in the ignoblest form of a fashion&mdash;have, or had but yesterday,
the control of the popular pen.&nbsp; Trivial pessimism or trivial optimism,
it matters little which prevails.&nbsp; For those who follow the one
habit to-day would have followed the other in a past generation.&nbsp;
Fleeting as they are, it cannot be within their competence to neglect
or reject the philosophy of &ldquo;In Memoriam.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the
dainty stanzas of that poem, it is true, no great struggle of reasoning
was to be committed, nor would any such dispute be judiciously entrusted
to the rhymes of a song of sorrow.&nbsp; Tennyson here proposes, rather
than closes with, the ultimate question of our destiny.&nbsp; The conflict,
for which he proves himself strong enough, is in that magnificent poem
of a thinker, &ldquo;Lucretius.&rdquo;&nbsp; But so far as &ldquo;In
Memoriam&rdquo; attempts, weighs, falters, and confides, it is true
to the experience of human anguish and intellect.</p>
<p>I say intellect advisedly.&nbsp; Not for him such blunders of thought
as Coleridge&rsquo;s in &ldquo;The Ancient Mariner&rdquo; or Wordsworth&rsquo;s
in &ldquo;Hartleap Well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Coleridge names the sun, moon,
and stars as when, in a dream, the sleeping imagination is threatened
with some significant illness.&nbsp; We see them in his great poem as
apparitions.&nbsp; Coleridge&rsquo;s senses are infinitely and transcendently
spiritual.&nbsp; But a candid reader must be permitted to think the
mere story silly.&nbsp; The wedding-guest might rise the morrow morn
a sadder but he assuredly did not rise a wiser man.</p>
<p>As for Wordsworth, the most beautiful stanzas of &ldquo;Hartleap
Well&rdquo; are fatally rebuked by the truths of Nature.&nbsp; He shows
us the ruins of an aspen wood, a blighted hollow, a dreary place, forlorn
because an innocent stag, hunted, had there broken his heart in a leap
from the rocks above; grass would not grow there.</p>
<blockquote><p>This beast not unobserved by Nature fell,<br />
His death was mourned by sympathy divine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the signs of that sympathy are cruelly asserted by the poet to
be these woodland ruins&mdash;cruelly, because the daily sight of the
world blossoming over the agonies of beast and bird is made less tolerable
to us by such a fiction.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Being that is in the clouds and air<br />
. . .<br />
Maintains a deep and reverential care<br />
For the unoffending creature whom He loves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poet offers us as a proof of that &ldquo;reverential care,&rdquo;
the visible alteration of Nature at the scene of suffering&mdash;an
alteration we have to dispense with every day we pass in the woods.&nbsp;
We are tempted to ask whether Wordsworth himself believed in a sympathy
he asks us&mdash;on such grounds!&mdash;to believe in?&nbsp; Did he
think his faith to be worthy of no more than a fictitious sign and a
false proof?</p>
<p>Nowhere in the whole of Tennyson&rsquo;s thought is there such an
attack upon our reason and our heart.&nbsp; He is more serious than
the solemn Wordsworth.</p>
<p><i>In</i> <i>Memoriam</i>, with all else that Tennyson wrote, tutors,
with here and there a subtle word, this nature-loving nation to perceive
land, light, sky, and ocean, as he perceived.&nbsp; To this we return,
upon this we dwell.&nbsp; He has been to us, firstly, the poet of two
geniuses&mdash;a small and an immense; secondly, the modern poet who
answered in the negative that most significant modern question, French
or not French?&nbsp; But he was, before the outset of all our study
of him, of all our love of him, the poet of landscape, and this he is
more dearly than pen can describe him.&nbsp; This eternal character
of his is keen in the verse that is winged to meet a homeward ship with
her &ldquo;dewy decks,&rdquo; and in the sudden island landscape,</p>
<blockquote><p>The clover sod,<br />
That takes the sunshine and the rains,<br />
Or where the kneeling hamlet drains<br />
The chalice of the grapes of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is poignant in the garden-night:-</p>
<blockquote><p>A breeze began to tremble o&rsquo;er<br />
The large leaves of the sycamore,<br />
. . .<br />
And gathering freshlier overhead,<br />
Rocked the full-foliaged elm, and swung<br />
The heavy-folded rose, and flung<br />
The lilies to and fro, and said<br />
&ldquo;The dawn, the dawn,&rdquo; and died away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His are the exalted senses that sensual poets know nothing of.&nbsp;
I think the sense of hearing as well as the sense of sight, has never
been more greatly exalted than by Tennyson:-</p>
<blockquote><p>As from beyond the limit of the world,<br />
Like the last echo born of a great cry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to this garden-character so much decried I confess that the &ldquo;lawn&rdquo;
does not generally delight me, the word nor the thing.&nbsp; But in
Tennyson&rsquo;s page the word is wonderful, as though it had never
been dull: &ldquo;The mountain lawn was dewy-dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
not that he brings the mountains too near or ranks them in his own peculiar
garden-plot, but that the word withdraws, withdraws to summits, withdraws
into dreams; the lawn is aloft, alone, and as wild as ancient snow.&nbsp;
It is the same with many another word or phrase changed, by passing
into his vocabulary, into something rich and strange.&nbsp; His own
especially is the March month&mdash;his &ldquo;roaring moon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His is the spirit of the dawning month of flowers and storms; the golden,
soft names of daffodil and crocus are caught by the gale as you speak
them in his verse, in a fine disproportion with the energy and gloom.&nbsp;
His was a new apprehension of nature, an increase in the number, and
not only in the sum, of our national apprehensions of poetry in nature.&nbsp;
Unaware of a separate angel of modern poetry is he who is insensible
to the Tennyson note&mdash;the new note that we reaffirm even with the
notes of Vaughan, Traherne, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Blake well in our
ears&mdash;the Tennyson note of splendour, all-distinct.&nbsp; He showed
the perpetually transfigured landscape in transfiguring words.&nbsp;
He is the captain of our dreams.&nbsp; Others have lighted a candle
in England, he lit a sun.&nbsp; Through him our daily suns, and also
the backward and historic suns long since set, which he did not sing,
are magnified; and he bestows upon us an exalted retrospection.&nbsp;
Through him Napoleon&rsquo;s sun of Austerlitz rises, for us, with a
more brilliant menace upon arms and the plain; through him Fielding&rsquo;s
&ldquo;most melancholy sun&rdquo; lights the dying man to the setting-forth
on that last voyage of his with such an immortal gleam, denying hope,
as would not have lighted, for us, the memory of that seaward morning,
had our poetry not undergone the illumination, the transcendent vision,
of Tennyson&rsquo;s genius.</p>
<p>Emerson knew that the poet speaks adequately then only when he speaks
&ldquo;a little wildly, or with the flower of the mind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Tennyson, the clearest-headed of poets, is our wild poet; wild, notwithstanding
that little foppery we know of in him&mdash;that walking delicately,
like Agag; wild, notwithstanding the work, the ease, the neatness, the
finish; notwithstanding the assertion of manliness which, in asserting,
somewhat misses that mark; a wilder poet than the rough, than the sensual,
than the defiant, than the accuser, than the denouncer.&nbsp; Wild flowers
are his&mdash;great poet&mdash;wild winds, wild lights, wild heart,
wild eyes!</p>
<h2>DICKENS AS A MAN OF LETTERS</h2>
<p>It was said for many years, until the reversal that now befalls the
sayings of many years had happened to this also, that Thackeray was
the unkind satirist and Dickens the kind humourist.&nbsp; The truth
seems to be that Dickens imagined more evil people than did Thackeray,
but that he had an eager faith in good ones.&nbsp; Nothing places him
so entirely out of date as his trust in human sanctity, his love of
it, his hope for it, his leap at it.&nbsp; He saw it in a woman&rsquo;s
face first met, and drew it to himself in a man&rsquo;s hand first grasped.&nbsp;
He looked keenly for it.&nbsp; And if he associated minor degrees of
goodness with any kind of folly or mental ineptitude, he did not so
relate sanctity; though he gave it, for companion, ignorance; and joined
the two, in Joe Gargery, most tenderly.&nbsp; We might paraphrase, in
regard to these two great authors, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s famous sentence:
&ldquo;Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no joys.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Dickens has many scoundrels, but Thackeray has no saints.&nbsp; Helen
Pendennis is not holy, for she is unjust and cruel; Amelia is not holy,
for she is an egoist in love; Lady Castlewood is not holy, for she too
is cruel; and even Lady Jane is not holy, for she is jealous; nor is
Colonel Newcome holy, for he is haughty; nor Dobbin, for he turns with
a taunt upon a plain sister; nor Esmond, for he squanders his best years
in love for a material beauty; and these are the best of his good people.&nbsp;
And readers have been taught to praise the work of him who makes none
perfect; one does not meet perfect people in trains or at dinner, and
this seemed good cause that the novelist should be praised for his moderation;
it seemed to imitate the usual measure and moderation of nature.</p>
<p>But Charles Dickens closed with a divine purpose divinely different.&nbsp;
He consented to the counsels of perfection.&nbsp; And thus he made Joe
Gargery, not a man one might easily find in a forge; and Esther Summerson,
not a girl one may easily meet at a dance; and Little Dorrit, who does
not come to do a day&rsquo;s sewing; not that the man and the women
are inconceivable, but that they are unfortunately improbable.&nbsp;
They are creatures created through a creating mind that worked its six
days for the love of good, and never rested until the seventh, the final
Sabbath.&nbsp; But granting that they are the counterpart, the heavenly
side, of caricature, this is not to condemn them.&nbsp; Since when has
caricature ceased to be an art good for man&mdash;an honest game between
him and nature?&nbsp; It is a tenable opinion that frank caricature
is a better incident of art than the mere exaggeration which is the
more modern practice.&nbsp; The words mean the same thing in their origin&mdash;an
overloading.&nbsp; But, as we now generally delimit the words, they
differ.&nbsp; Caricature, when it has the grotesque inspiration, makes
for laughter, and when it has the celestial, makes for admiration; in
either case there is a good understanding between the author and the
reader, or between the draughtsman and the spectator.&nbsp; We need
not, for example, suppose that Ibsen sat in a room surrounded by a repeating
pattern of his hair and whiskers on the wallpaper, but it makes us most
exceedingly mirthful and joyous to see him thus seated in Mr. Max Beerbohm&rsquo;s
drawing; and perhaps no girl ever went through life without harbouring
a thought of self, but it is very good for us all to know that such
a girl was thought of by Dickens, that he loved his thought, and that
she is ultimately to be traced, through Dickens, to God.</p>
<p>But exaggeration establishes no good understanding between the reader
and the author.&nbsp; It is a solemn appeal to our credulity, and we
are right to resent it.&nbsp; It is the violence of a weakling hand&mdash;the
worst manner of violence.&nbsp; Exaggeration is conspicuous in the newer
poetry, and is so far, therefore, successful, conspicuousness being
its aim.&nbsp; But it was also the vice of Swinburne, and was the bad
example he set to the generation that thought his tunings to be the
finest &ldquo;music.&rdquo;&nbsp; For instance, in an early poem he
intends to tell us how a man who loved a woman welcomed the sentence
that condemned him to drown with her, bound, his impassioned breast
against hers, abhorring.&nbsp; He might have convinced us of that welcome
by one phrase of the profound exactitude of genius.&nbsp; But he makes
his man cry out for the greatest bliss and the greatest imaginable glory
to be bestowed upon the judge who pronounces the sentence.&nbsp; And
this is merely exaggeration.&nbsp; One takes pleasure in rebuking the
false ecstasy by a word thus prim and prosaic.&nbsp; The poet intended
to impose upon us, and he fails; we &ldquo;withdraw our attention,&rdquo;
as Dr. Johnson did when the conversation became foolish.&nbsp; In truth
we do more, for we resent exaggeration if we care for our English language.&nbsp;
For exaggeration writes relaxed, and not elastic, words and verses;
and it is possible that the language suffers something, at least temporarily&mdash;during
the life of a couple of generations, let us say&mdash;from the loss
of elasticity and rebound brought about by such strain.&nbsp; Moreover,
exaggeration has always to outdo itself progressively.&nbsp; There should
have been a Durdles to tell this Swinburne that the habit of exaggerating,
like that of boasting, &ldquo;grows upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be added that later poetry shows us an instance of exaggeration
in the work of that major poet, Mr. Lascelles Abercrombie.&nbsp; His
violence and vehemence, his extremity, are generally signs not of weakness
but of power; and yet once he reaches a breaking-point that power should
never know.&nbsp; This is where his Judith holds herself to be so smirched
and degraded by the proffer of a reverent love (she being devoted to
one only, a dead man who had her heart) that thenceforth no bar is left
to her entire self-sacrifice to the loathed enemy Holofernes.&nbsp;
To this, too, the prim rebuke is the just one, a word for the mouth
of governesses: &ldquo;My dear, you exaggerate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be briefly said that exaggeration takes for granted some degree
of imbecility in the reader, whereas caricature takes for granted a
high degree of intelligence.&nbsp; Dickens appeals to our intelligence
in all his caricature, whether heavenly, as in Joe Gargery, or impish,
as in Mrs. Micawber.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;caricature&rdquo; that is
used a thousand times to reproach him is the word that does him singular
honour.</p>
<p>If I may define my own devotion to Dickens, it may be stated as chiefly,
though not wholly, admiration of his humour, his dramatic tragedy, and
his watchfulness over inanimate things and landscape.&nbsp; Passages
of his books that are ranged otherwise than under those characters often
leave me out of the range of their appeal or else definitely offend
me.&nbsp; And this is not for the customary reason&mdash;that Dickens
could not draw a gentleman, that Dickens could not draw a lady.&nbsp;
It matters little whether he could or not.&nbsp; But as a fact he did
draw a gentleman, and drew him excellently well, in Cousin Feenix, as
Mr. Chesterton has decided.&nbsp; The question of the lady we may waive;
if it is difficult to prove a negative, it is difficult also to present
one; and to the making, or producing, or liberating, or detaching, or
exalting, of the character of a lady there enter many negatives; and
Dickens was an obvious and a positive man.&nbsp; Esther Summerson is
a lady, but she is so much besides that her ladyhood does not detach
itself from her sainthood and her angelhood, so as to be conspicuous&mdash;if,
indeed, conspicuousness may be properly predicated of the quality of
a lady.&nbsp; It is a conventional saying that sainthood and angelhood
include the quality of a lady, but that saying is not true; a lady has
a great number of negatives all her own, and also some things positive
that are not at all included in goodness.&nbsp; However this may be&mdash;and
it is not important&mdash;Dickens, the genial Dickens, makes savage
sport of women.&nbsp; Such a company of envious dames and damsels cannot
be found among the persons of the satirist Thackeray.&nbsp; Kate Nickleby&rsquo;s
beauty brings upon her at first sight the enmity of her workshop companions;
in the innocent pages of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; the aunt is jealous
of the niece, and the niece retorts by wounding the vanity of the aunt
as keenly as she may; and so forth through early books and late.&nbsp;
He takes for granted that the women, old and young, who are not his
heroines, wage this war within the sex, being disappointed by defect
of nature and fortune.&nbsp; Dickens is master of wit, humour, and derision;
and it must be confessed that his derision is abundant, and is cast
upon an artificially exposed and helpless people; that is, he, a man,
derides the women who miss what a man declared to be their &ldquo;whole
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The advice which M. Rodin received in his youth from Constant&mdash;&ldquo;Learn
to see the other side; never look at forms only in extent; learn to
see them always in relief&rdquo;&mdash;is the contrary of the counsel
proper for a reader of Dickens.&nbsp; That counsel should be, &ldquo;Do
not insist upon seeing the immortal figures of comedy &lsquo;in the
round.&rsquo;&nbsp; You are to be satisfied with their face value, the
face of two dimensions.&nbsp; It is not necessary that you should seize
Mr. Pecksniff from beyond, and grasp the whole man and his destinies.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The hypocrite is a figure dreadful and tragic, a shape of horror; and
Mr. Pecksniff is a hypocrite, and a bright image of heart-easing comedy.&nbsp;
For comic fiction cannot exist without some such paradox.&nbsp; Without
it, where would our laugh be in response to the generous genius which
gives us Mr. Pecksniff&rsquo;s parenthesis to the mention of sirens
(&ldquo;Pagan, I regret to say&rdquo;); and the scene in which Mr. Pecksniff,
after a stormy domestic scene within, goes as it were accidentally to
the door to admit the rich kinsman he wishes to propitiate?&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
Mr. Pecksniff, gently warbling a rustic stave, put on his garden hat,
seized a spade, and opened the street door, as if he thought he had,
from his vineyard, heard a modest rap, but was not quite certain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The visitor had thundered at the door while outcries of family strife
had been rising in the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;It is an ancient pursuit,
gardening.&nbsp; Primitive, my dear sir; for, if I am not mistaken,
Adam was the first of the calling.&nbsp; My Eve, I grieve to say, is
no more, sir; but&rsquo; (and here he pointed to his spade, and shook
his head, as if he were not cheerful without an effort) &lsquo;but I
do a little bit of Adam still.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had by this time got
them into the best parlour, where the portrait by Spiller and the bust
by Spoker were.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, Mr. Pecksniff, hospitable at
the supper table: &ldquo;&lsquo;This,&rsquo; he said, in allusion to
the party, not the wine, &lsquo;is a Mingling that repays one for much
disappointment and vexation.&nbsp; Let us be merry.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here
he took a captain&rsquo;s biscuit.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a poor heart that
never rejoices; and our hearts are not poor.&nbsp; No!&rsquo;&nbsp;
With such stimulants to merriment did he beguile the time and do the
honours of the table.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover it is a mournful thing and
an inexplicable, that a man should be as mad as Mr. Dick.&nbsp; None
the less is it a happy thing for any reader to watch Mr. Dick while
David explains his difficulty to Traddles.&nbsp; Mr. Dick was to be
employed in copying, but King Charles the First could not be kept out
of the manuscripts; &ldquo;Mr. Dick in the meantime looking very deferentially
and seriously at Traddles, and sucking his thumb.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
amours of the gentleman in gaiters who threw the vegetable-marrows over
the garden wall.&nbsp; Mr. F.&rsquo;s aunt, again!&nbsp; And Augustus
Moddle, our own Moddle, whom a great French critic most justly and accurately
brooded over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Augustus, the gloomy maniac,&rdquo; says
Taine, &ldquo;makes us shudder.&rdquo;&nbsp; A good medical diagnosis.&nbsp;
Long live the logical French intellect!</p>
<p>Truly, Humour talks in his own language, nay, his own dialect, whereas
Passion and Pity speak the universal tongue.</p>
<p>It is strange&mdash;it seems to me deplorable&mdash;that Dickens
himself was not content to leave his wonderful hypocrite&mdash;one who
should stand imperishable in comedy&mdash;in the two dimensions of his
own admirable art.&nbsp; After he had enjoyed his own Pecksniff, tasting
him with the &ldquo;strenuous tongue&rdquo; of Keats&rsquo;s voluptuary
bursting &ldquo;joy&rsquo;s grapes against his palate fine,&rdquo; Dickens
most unfairly gives himself the other and incompatible joy of grasping
his Pecksniff in the third dimension, seizes him &ldquo;in the round,&rdquo;
horsewhips him out of all keeping, and finally kicks him out of a splendid
art of fiction into a sorry art of &ldquo;poetical justice,&rdquo; a
Pecksniff not only defeated but undone.</p>
<p>And yet Dickens&rsquo;s retribution upon sinners is a less fault
than his reforming them.&nbsp; It is truly an act denoting excessive
simplicity of mind in him.&nbsp; He never veritably allows his responsibility
as a man to lapse.&nbsp; Men ought to be good, or else to become good,
and he does violence to his own excellent art, and yields it up to his
sense of morality.&nbsp; Ah, can we measure by years the time between
that day and this?&nbsp; Is the fastidious, the impartial, the non-moral
novelist only the grandchild, and not the remote posterity, of Dickens,
who would not leave Scrooge to his egoism, or Gradgrind to his facts,
or Mercy Pecksniff to her absurdity, or Dombey to his pride?&nbsp; Nay,
who makes Micawber finally to prosper?&nbsp; Truly, the most unpardonable
thing Dickens did in those deplorable last chapters of his was the prosperity
of Mr. Micawber.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a son, in difficulties&rdquo;&mdash;the
perfect Micawber nature is respected as to his origin, and then perverted
as to his end.&nbsp; It is a pity that Mr. Peggotty ever came back to
England with such tidings.&nbsp; And our last glimpse of the emigrants
had been made joyous by the sight of the young Micawbers on the eve
of emigration; &ldquo;every child had its own wooden spoon attached
to its body by a strong line,&rdquo; in preparation for Colonial life.&nbsp;
And then Dickens must needs go behind the gay scenes, and tell us that
the long and untiring delight of the book was over.&nbsp; Mr. Micawber,
in the Colonies, was never again to make punch with lemons, in a crisis
of his fortunes, and &ldquo;resume his peeling with a desperate air&rdquo;;
nor to observe the expression of his friends&rsquo; faces during Mrs.
Micawber&rsquo;s masterly exposition of the financial situation or of
the possibilities of the coal trade; nor to eat walnuts out of a paper
bag what time the die was cast and all was over.&nbsp; Alas! nothing
was over until Mr. Micawber&rsquo;s pecuniary liabilities were over,
and the perfect comedy turned into dulness, the joyous impossibility
of a figure of immortal fun into cold improbability.</p>
<p>There are several such late or last chapters that one would gladly
cut away: that of Mercy Pecksniff&rsquo;s pathos, for example; that
of Mr. Dombey&rsquo;s installation in his daughter&rsquo;s home; that
which undeceives us as to Mr. Boffin&rsquo;s antic disposition.&nbsp;
But how true and how whole a heart it was that urged these unlucky conclusions!&nbsp;
How shall we venture to complain?&nbsp; The hand that made its Pecksniff
in pure wit, has it not the right to belabour him in earnest&mdash;albeit
a kind of earnest that disappoints us?&nbsp; And Mr. Dombey is Dickens&rsquo;s
own Dombey, and he must do what he will with that finely wrought figure
of pride.&nbsp; But there is a little irony in the fact that Dickens
leaves more than one villain to his orderly fate for whom we care little
either way; it is nothing to us, whom Carker never convinced, that the
train should catch him, nor that the man with the moustache and the
nose, who did but weary us, should be crushed by the falling house.&nbsp;
Here the end holds good in art, but the art was not good from the first.&nbsp;
But then, again, neither does Bill Sikes experience a change of heart,
nor Jonas Chuzzlewit; and the end of each is most excellently told.</p>
<p>George Meredith said that the most difficult thing to write in fiction
was dialogue.&nbsp; But there is surely one thing at least as difficult&mdash;a
thing so rarely well done that a mere reader might think it to be more
difficult than dialogue; and that is the telling <i>what</i> <i>happened</i>.&nbsp;
Something of the fatal languor and preoccupation that persist beneath
all the violence of our stage&mdash;our national undramatic character&mdash;is
perceptible in the narrative of our literature.&nbsp; The things the
usual modern author says are proportionately more energetically produced
than those he tells.&nbsp; But Dickens, being simple and dramatic and
capable of one thing at a time, and that thing whole, tells us what
happened with a perfect speed which has neither hurry nor delays.&nbsp;
Those who saw him act found him a fine actor, and this we might know
by reading the murder in <i>Oliver</i> <i>Twist</i>, the murder in <i>Martin</i>
<i>Chuzzlewit</i>, the coming of the train upon Carker, the long moment
of recognition when Pip sees his guest, the convict, reveal himself
in his chambers at night.&nbsp; The swift spirit, the hammering blow
of his narrative, drive the great storm in <i>David</i> <i>Copperfield</i>
through the poorest part of the book&mdash;Steerforth&rsquo;s story.&nbsp;
There is surely no greater gale to be read of than this: from the first
words, &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that,&rsquo; I said to the
coachman, &lsquo;a very remarkable sky?&rsquo;&rdquo; to the end of
a magnificent chapter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Flying clouds tossed up into most
remarkable heaps, suggesting greater heights in the clouds than there
were depths below them. . . There had been a wind all day; and it was
rising then with an extraordinary great sound . . . Long before we saw
the sea, its spray was on our lips . . . The water was out over the
flat country, and every sheet and puddle lashed its banks, and had its
stress of little breakers.&nbsp; When we came within sight of the sea,
the waves on the horizon, caught at intervals above the boiling abyss,
were like glimpses of another shore, with towers and buildings. . .
The people came to their doors all aslant, and with streaming hair.&rdquo;&nbsp;
David dreams of a cannonade, when at last he &ldquo;fell&mdash;off a
tower and down a precipice&mdash;into the depths of sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the morning, &ldquo;the wind might have lulled a little, though not
more sensibly than if the cannonading I had dreamed of had been diminished
by the silencing of half a dozen guns out of hundreds.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It went from me with a shock, like a ball from a rifle,&rdquo;
says David in another place, after the visit of a delirious impulse;
here is the volley of departure, the shock of passion vanishing more
perceptibly than it came.</p>
<p>The tempest in <i>David</i> <i>Copperfield</i> combines Dickens&rsquo;s
dramatic tragedy of narrative with his wonderful sense of sea and land.&nbsp;
But here are landscapes in quietness: &ldquo;There has been rain this
afternoon, and a wintry shudder goes among the little pools in the cracked,
uneven flag-stones. . . Some of the leaves, in a timid rush, seek sanctuary
within the low-arched cathedral door; but two men coming out resist
them, and cast them out with their feet:&rdquo;&nbsp; The autumn leaves
fall thick, &ldquo;but never fast, for they come circling down with
a dead lightness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;Now the woods settle into
great masses as if they were one profound tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet
again, &ldquo;I held my mother in my embrace, and she held me in hers;
and among the still woods in the silence of the summer day there seemed
to be nothing but our two troubled minds that was not at peace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yet, with a thousand great felicities of diction, Dickens had no <i>body</i>
of style.</p>
<p>Dickens, having the single and simple heart of a moralist, had also
the simple eyes of a free intelligence, and the light heart.&nbsp; He
gave his senses their way, and well did they serve him.&nbsp; Thus his
eyes&mdash;and no more modern man in anxious search of &ldquo;impressions&rdquo;
was ever so simple and so masterly: &ldquo;Mr. Vholes gauntly stalked
to the fire, and warmed his funereal gloves.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;I
thank you,&rsquo; said Mr. Vholes, putting out his long black sleeve,
to check the ringing of the bell, &lsquo;not any.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. and Mrs. Tope &ldquo;are daintily sticking sprigs of holly into
the carvings and sconces of the cathedral stalls, as if they were sticking
them into the button-holes of the Dean &amp; Chapter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
two young Eurasians, brother and sister, &ldquo;had a certain air upon
them of hunter and huntress; yet withal a certain air of being the objects
of the chase rather than the followers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This phrase lacks
elegance&mdash;and Dickens is not often inelegant, as those who do not
read him may be surprised to learn&mdash;but the impression is admirable;
so is that which follows: &ldquo;An indefinable kind of pause coming
and going on their whole expression, both of face and form.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here is pure, mere impression again: &ldquo;Miss Murdstone, who was
busy at her writing-desk, gave me her cold finger-nails.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lady Tippins&rsquo;s hand is &ldquo;rich in knuckles.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
here is vision with great dignity: &ldquo;All beyond his figure was
a vast dark curtain, in solemn movement towards one quarter of the heavens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that singleness of sight&mdash;and his whole body was full of
the light of it&mdash;he had also the single hearing; the scene is in
the Court of Chancery on a London November day: &ldquo;Leaving this
address ringing in the rafters of the roof, the very little counsel
drops, and the fog knows him no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Vholes
emerged into the silence he could scarcely be said to have broken, so
stifled was his tone.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Within the grill-gate of the
chancel, up the steps surmounted loomingly by the fast-darkening organ,
white robes could be dimly seen, and one feeble voice, rising and falling
in a cracked monotonous mutter, could at intervals be faintly heard
. . . until the organ and the choir burst forth and drowned it in a
sea of music.&nbsp; Then the sea fell, and the dying voice made another
feeble effort; and then the sea rose high and beat its life out, and
lashed the roof, and surged among the arches, and pierced the heights
of the great tower; and then the sea was dry and all was still.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And this is how a listener overheard men talking in the cathedral hollows:
&ldquo;The word &lsquo;confidence,&rsquo; shattered by the echoes, but
still capable of being pieced together, is uttered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wit, humour, derision&mdash;to each of these words we assign by custom
a part in the comedy of literature; and (again) those who do not read
Dickens&mdash;perhaps even those who read him a little&mdash;may acclaim
him as a humourist and not know him as a wit.&nbsp; But that writer
is a wit, whatever his humour, who tells us of a member of the Tite
Barnacle family who had held a sinecure office against all protest,
that &ldquo;he died with his drawn salary in his hand.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But let it be granted that Dickens the humourist is foremost and most
precious.&nbsp; For we might well spare the phrase of wit just quoted
rather than the one describing Traddles (whose hair stood up), as one
who looked &ldquo;as though he had seen a cheerful ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Or rather than this:-</p>
<blockquote><p>He was so wooden a man that he seemed to have taken his
wooden leg naturally, and rather suggested to the fanciful observer
that he might be expected&mdash;if his development received no untimely
check&mdash;to be completely set up with a pair of wooden legs in about
six months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or rather than the incident of the butcher and the beef-steak.&nbsp;
He gently presses it, in a cabbage leaf, into Tom Pinch&rsquo;s pocket.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;For meat,&rsquo; he said with some emotion, &lsquo;must
be humoured, not drove.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A generation, between his own and the present, thought Dickens to
be vulgar; if the cause of that judgement was that he wrote about people
in shops, the cause is discredited now that shops are the scenes of
the novelist&rsquo;s research.&nbsp; &ldquo;High life&rdquo; and most
wretched life have now given place to the little shop and its parlour,
during a year or two.&nbsp; But Dr. Brown, the author of <i>Rab</i>
<i>and</i> <i>His</i> <i>Friends</i>, thought that Dickens committed
vulgarities in his diction.&nbsp; &ldquo;A good man was Robin&rdquo;
is right enough; but &ldquo;He was a good man, was Robin&rdquo; is not
so well, and we must own that it is Dickensian; but assuredly Dickens
writes such phrases as it were dramatically, playing the cockney.&nbsp;
I know of but two words that Dickens habitually misuses, and Charles
Lamb misuses one of them precisely in Dickens&rsquo;s manner; it is
not worth while to quote them.&nbsp; But for these his English is admirable;
he chooses what is good and knows what is not.&nbsp; A little representative
collection of the bad or foolish English of his day might be made by
gathering up what Dickens forbore and what he derided; for instance,
Mr. Micawber&rsquo;s portly phrase, &ldquo;gratifying emotions of no
common description,&rdquo; and Littimer&rsquo;s report that &ldquo;the
young woman was partial to the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the polite
language of that time, as we conclude when we find it to be the language
that Charlotte Bront&euml; shook off; but before she shook it off she
used it.&nbsp; Dickens, too, had something to throw off; in his earlier
books there is an inflation&mdash;rounded words fill the inappropriate
mouth of Bill Sikes himself&mdash;but he discarded them with a splendid
laugh.&nbsp; They are charged upon Mr. Micawber in his own character
as author.&nbsp; See him as he sits by to hear Captain Hopkins read
the petition in the debtors&rsquo; prison &ldquo;from His Most Gracious
Majesty&rsquo;s unfortunate subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Micawber listened,
we read, &ldquo;with a little of an author&rsquo;s vanity, contemplating
(not severely) the spikes upon the opposite wall.&rdquo;&nbsp; It should
be remembered that when Dickens shook himself free of everything that
hampered his genius he was not so much beloved or so much applauded
as when he gave to his cordial readers matter for facile sentiment and
for humour of the second order.&nbsp; His public were eager to be moved
and to laugh, and he gave them Little Nell and Sam Weller; he loved
to please them, and it is evident that he pleased himself also.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Micawber, Mr. Pecksniff, Mrs. Nickleby, Mrs. Chick, Mrs. Pipchin,
Mr. Augustus Moddle, Mrs. Jellyby, Mrs. Plornish, are not so famous
as Sam Weller and Little Nell, nor is Traddles, whose hair looked as
though he had seen a cheerful ghost.</p>
<p>We are told of the delight of the Japanese man in a chance finding
of something strange-shaped, an asymmetry that has an accidental felicity,
an interest.&nbsp; If he finds such a grace or disproportion&mdash;whatever
the interest may be&mdash;in a stone or a twig that has caught his ambiguous
eye at the roadside, he carries it to his home to place it in its irregularly
happy place.&nbsp; Dickens seems to have had a like joy in things misshapen
or strangely shapen, uncommon or grotesque.&nbsp; He saddled even his
heroes&mdash;those heroes are, perhaps, his worst work, young men at
once conventional and improbable&mdash;with whimsically ugly names;
while his invented names are whimsically perfect: that of Vholes for
the predatory silent man in black, and that of Tope for the cathedral
verger.&nbsp; A suggestion of dark and vague flight in Vholes; something
of old floors, something respectably furtive and musty, in Tope.&nbsp;
In Dickens, the love of lurking, unusual things, human and inanimate&mdash;he
wrote of his discoveries delightedly in his letters&mdash;was hypertrophied;
and it has its part in the simplest and the most fantastic of his humours,
especially those that are due to his child-like eyesight; let us read,
for example, of the rooks that seemed to attend upon Dr. Strong (late
of Canterbury) in his Highgate garden, &ldquo;as if they had been written
to about him by the Canterbury rooks and were observing him closely
in consequence&rdquo;; and of Master Micawber, who had a remarkable
head voice&mdash;&ldquo;On looking at Master Micawber again I saw that
he had a certain expression of face as if his voice were behind his
eyebrows&rdquo;; and of Joe in his Sunday clothes, &ldquo;a scarecrow
in good circumstances&rdquo;; and of the cook&rsquo;s cousin in the
Life Guards, with such long legs that &ldquo;he looked like the afternoon
shadow of somebody else&rdquo;; and of Mrs. Markleham, &ldquo;who stared
more like a figure-head intended for a ship to be called the Astonishment,
than anything else I can think of.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there is no reader
who has not a thousand such exhilarating little sights in his memory
of these pages.&nbsp; From the gently grotesque to the fantastic run
Dickens&rsquo;s enchanted eyes, and in Quilp and Miss Mowcher he takes
his joy in the extreme of deformity; and a spontaneous combustion was
an accident much to his mind.</p>
<p>Dickens wrote for a world that either was exceedingly excitable and
sentimental, or had the convention or tradition of great sentimental
excitability.&nbsp; All his people, suddenly surprised, lose their presence
of mind.&nbsp; Even when the surprise is not extraordinary their actions
are wild.&nbsp; When Tom Pinch calls upon John Westlock in London, after
no very long separation, John, welcoming him at breakfast, puts the
rolls into his boots, and so forth.&nbsp; And this kind of distraction
comes upon men and women everywhere in his books&mdash;distractions
of laughter as well.&nbsp; All this seems artificial to-day, whereas
Dickens in his best moments is the simplest, as he is the most vigilant,
of men.&nbsp; But his public was as present to him as an actor&rsquo;s
audience is to the actor, and I cannot think that this immediate response
was good for his art.&nbsp; Assuredly he is not solitary.&nbsp; We should
not wish him to be solitary as a poet is, but we may wish that now and
again, even while standing applauded and acclaimed, he had appraised
the applause more coolly and more justly, and within his inner mind.</p>
<p>Those critics who find what they call vulgarisms think they may safely
go on to accuse Dickens of bad grammar.&nbsp; The truth is that his
grammar is not only good but strong; it is far better in construction
than Thackeray&rsquo;s, the ease of whose phrase sometimes exceeds and
is slack.&nbsp; Lately, during the recent centenary time, a writer averred
that Dickens &ldquo;might not always be parsed,&rdquo; but that we loved
him for his, etc., etc.&nbsp; Dickens&rsquo;s page is to be parsed as
strictly as any man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is, apart from the matter of grammar,
a wonderful thing that he, with his little education, should have so
excellent a diction.&nbsp; In a letter that records his reluctance to
work during a holiday, the word &ldquo;wave&rdquo; seems to me perfect:
&ldquo;Imaginary butchers and bakers wave me to my desk.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In his exquisite use of the word &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; in the
following phrase, we find his own perfect sense of the use of words
in his own day; but in the second quotation given there is a most beautiful
sign of education.&nbsp; &ldquo;Under the weight of my wicked secret&rdquo;
(the little boy Pip had succoured his convict with his brother-in-law&rsquo;s
provisions) &ldquo;I pondered whether the Church would be powerful enough
to shield me . . if I divulged to that establishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
this is the phrase that may remind us of the eighteenth-century writers
of prose, and among those writers of none so readily as of Bolingbroke:
it occurs in that passage of Esther&rsquo;s life in which, having lost
her beauty, she resolves to forego a love unavowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
was nothing to be undone; no chain for him to drag or for me to break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Dickens had had the education which he had not, his English could
not have been better; but if he had had the <i>usage</i> <i>du</i> <i>monde</i>
which as a young man he had not, there would have been a difference.&nbsp;
He would not, for instance, have given us the preposterous scenes in
<i>Nicholas</i> <i>Nickleby</i> in which parts are played by Lord Frederick
Verisopht, Sir Mulberry Hawke, and their friends; the scene of the hero&rsquo;s
luncheon at a restaurant and the dreadful description of the mirrors
and other splendours would not have been written.&nbsp; It is a very
little thing to forgive to him whom we have to thank for&mdash;well,
not perhaps for the &ldquo;housefull of friends&rdquo; for the gift
of whom a stranger, often quoted, once blessed him in the street; we
may not wish for Mr. Feeder, or Major Bagstock, or Mrs. Chick, or Mrs.
Pipchin, or Mr. Augustus Moddle, or Mr. F.&rsquo;s aunt, or Mr. Wopsle,
or Mr. Pumblechook, as an inmate of our homes.&nbsp; Lack of knowledge
of the polite world is, I say, a very little thing to forgive to him
whom we thank most chiefly for showing us these interesting people just
named as inmates of the comedy homes that are not ours.&nbsp; We thank
him because they are comedy homes, and could not be ours or any man&rsquo;s;
that is, we thank him for his admirable art.</p>
<h2>SWINBURNE&rsquo;S LYRICAL POETRY</h2>
<p>The makers of epigrams, of phrases, of pages&mdash;of all more or
less brief judgements&mdash;assuredly waste their time when they sum
up any one of all mankind; and how do they squander it when their matter
is a poet!&nbsp; They may hardly describe him; nor shall any student&rsquo;s
care, or psychologist&rsquo;s formula, or man-of-letters&rsquo; summary,
or wit&rsquo;s sentence define him.&nbsp; Definitions, because they
must not be inexact or incomprehensive, sweep too wide, and the poet
is not held within them; and out of the mere describer&rsquo;s range
and capture he may escape by as many doors as there are outlets from
a forest.&nbsp; But much ready-made platitude brings about the world&rsquo;s
guesses at a poet, and false and flat thought lies behind its epigrams.&nbsp;
It is not long since the general guess-work assigned melancholy, without
authority, to a poet lately deceased.&nbsp; Real poets, it was said,
are unhappy, and this was one exceptionally real.&nbsp; How unhappy
must he, then, certainly have been!&nbsp; And the blessed Blake himself
was incidentally cited as one of the company of depression and despair!&nbsp;
It is, perhaps, a liking for symmetry that prompts these futile syllogisms;
perhaps, also, it is the fear of human mystery.&nbsp; The biographer
used to see &ldquo;the finger of God&rdquo; pat in the history of a
man; he insists now that he shall at any rate see the finger of a law,
or rather of a rule, a custom, a generality.&nbsp; Law I will not call
it; there is no intelligible law that, for example, a true poet should
be an unhappy man; but the observer thinks he has noticed a custom or
habit to that effect, and Blake, who lived and died in bliss, is named
at ignorant random, rather than that an example of the custom should
be lost.</p>
<p>But it is not only such a platitude of observation, such a cheap
generality, that is silenced in the presence of the poet whose name
is at the head of these pages.&nbsp; For if ever Nature showed us a
poet in whom our phrases, and the judgements they record, should be
denied, defeated, and confused, Swinburne is he.&nbsp; We predicate
of a poet a great sincerity, a great imagination, a great passion, a
great intellect; these are the master qualities, and yet we are compelled
to see here&mdash;if we would not wilfully be blind or blindfold&mdash;a
poet, yes, a true poet, with a perfervid fancy rather than an imagination,
a poet with puny passions, a poet with no more than the momentary and
impulsive sincerity of an infirm soul, a poet with small intellect&mdash;and
thrice a poet.</p>
<p>And, assuredly, if the creative arts are duly humbled in the universal
contemplation of Nature, if they are accused, if they are weighed, if
they are found wanting; if they are excused by nothing but our intimate
human sympathy with dear and interesting imperfection; if poetry stands
outdone by the passion and experience of an inarticulate soul, and painting
by the splendour of the day, and building by the forest and the cloud,
there is another art also that has to be humiliated, and this is the
art and science of criticism, confounded by its contemplation of such
a poet.&nbsp; Poor little art of examination and formula!&nbsp; The
miracle of day and night and immortality are needed to rebuke the nobler
arts; but our art, the critic&rsquo;s, mine to-day, is brought to book,
and its heart is broken, and its sincerity disgraced, by the paradoxes
of the truth.&nbsp; Not in the heavens nor in the sub-celestial landscape
does this minor art find its refutation, but in the puzzle between a
man and his gift; and in part the man is ignoble and leads us by distasteful
paths, and compels us to a reluctant work of literary detection.&nbsp;
Useful is the critical spirit, but it loses heart when (to take a very
definite instance) it has to ask what literary sincerity&mdash;what
value for art and letters&mdash;lived in Swinburne, who hailed a certain
old friend, in a dedication, as &ldquo;poet and painter&rdquo; when
he was pleased with him, and declared him &ldquo;poetaster and dauber&rdquo;
when something in that dead man&rsquo;s posthumous autobiography offended
his own self-love; when, I say, criticism finds itself called upon,
amid its admiration, to do such scavenger work, it loses heart as well
as the clue, and would gladly go out into the free air of greater arts,
and, with them, take exterior Nature&rsquo;s nobler reprobation.</p>
<p>I have to cite this instance of a change of mind, or of terms and
titles, in Swinburne&rsquo;s estimate of art and letters, because it
is all-important to my argument.&nbsp; It is a change he makes in published
print, and, therefore, no private matter.&nbsp; And I cite it, not as
a sign of moral fault, with which I have no business, but as a sign
of a most significant literary insensibility&mdash;insensibility, whether
to the quality of a poetaster when he wrote &ldquo;poet,&rdquo; or to
that of a poet when he wrote &ldquo;poetaster,&rdquo; is of no matter.</p>
<p>Rather than justify the things I have ventured to affirm as to Swinburne&rsquo;s
little intellect, and paltry degree of sincerity, and rachitic passion,
and tumid fancy&mdash;judgement-confounding things to predicate of a
poet&mdash;I turn to the happier task of praise.&nbsp; A vivid writer
of English was he, and would have been one of the recurring renewers
of our often-renewed and incomparable language, had his words not become
habitual to himself, so that they quickly lost the light, the breeze,
the breath; one whose fondness for beauty deserved the serious name
of love; one whom beauty at times favoured and filled so visibly, by
such obvious visits and possessions, favours so manifest, that inevitably
we forget we are speaking fictions and allegories, and imagine her a
visiting power exterior to her poet; a man, moreover, of a less, not
more, than manly receptiveness and appreciation, so that he was entirely
and easily possessed by admirations.&nbsp; Less than manly we must call
his extraordinary recklessness of appreciation; it is, as it were, ideally
feminine; it is possible, however, that no woman has yet been capable
of so entire an emotional impulse and impetus; more than manly it might
have been but for the lack of a responsible intellect in that impulse;
had it possessed such an intellectual sanction, Swinburne&rsquo;s admiration
of Victor Hugo, Mazzini, Dickens, Baudelaire, and Th&eacute;ophile Gautier
might have added one to the great generosities of the world.</p>
<p>We are inclined to complain of such an objection to Swinburne&rsquo;s
poetry as was prevalent at his earlier appearance and may be found in
criticisms of the time, before the later fashion of praise set in&mdash;the
obvious objection that it was as indigent in thought as affluent in
words; for, though a truth, it is an inadequate truth.&nbsp; It might
be affirmed of many a verse-writer of not unusual talent and insignificance,
whose affluence of words was inselective and merely abundant, and whose
poverty of thought was something less than a national disaster.&nbsp;
Swinburne&rsquo;s failure of intellect was, in the fullest and most
serious sense, a national disaster, and his instinct for words was a
national surprise.&nbsp; It is in their beauty that Swinburne&rsquo;s
art finds its absolution from the obligations of meaning, according
to the vulgar judgement; and we can hardly wonder.</p>
<p>I wish it were not customary to write of one art in the terms of
another, and I use the words &ldquo;music&rdquo; and &ldquo;musical&rdquo;
under protest, because the world has been so delighted to call any verse
pleasant to the ear &ldquo;musical,&rdquo; that it has not supplied
us with another and more specialised and appropriate word.&nbsp; Swinburne
is a complete master of the rhythm and rhyme, the time and accent, the
pause, the balance, the flow of vowel and clash of consonant, that make
the &ldquo;music&rdquo; for which verse is popular and prized.&nbsp;
We need not complain that it is for the tune rather than for the melody&mdash;if
we must use those alien terms&mdash;that he is chiefly admired, and
even for the jingle rather than for the tune: he gave his readers all
three, and all three in perfection.&nbsp; Nineteen out of twenty who
take pleasure in this art of his will quote you first</p>
<blockquote><p>When the hounds of Spring are on winter&rsquo;s traces<br />
The Mother of months, in meadow and plain,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the rest of the buoyant familiar lines.&nbsp; I confess there
is something too obvious, insistent, emphatic, too dapper, to give me
more than a slight pleasure; but it is possible that I am prejudiced
by a dislike of English anapaests (I am aware that the classic terms
are not really applicable to our English metres, but the reader will
underhand that I mean the metre of the lines just quoted.)&nbsp; I do
not find these anapaests in the Elizabethan or in the seventeenth-century
poets, or most rarely.&nbsp; They were dear to the eighteenth century,
and, much more than the heroic couplet, are the distinctive metre of
that age.&nbsp; They swagger&mdash;or, worse, they strut&mdash;in its
lighter verse, from its first year to its last.&nbsp; Swinburne&rsquo;s
anapaests are far too delicate for swagger or strut; but for all their
dance, all their spring, all their flight, all their flutter, we are
compelled to perceive that, as it were, they <i>perform</i>.&nbsp; I
love to see English poetry move to many measures, to many numbers, but
chiefly with the simple iambic and the simple trochaic foot.&nbsp; Those
two are enough for the infinite variety, the epic, the drama, the lyric,
of our poetry.&nbsp; It is, accordingly, in these old traditional and
proved metres that Swinburne&rsquo;s music seems to me most worthy,
most controlled, and most lovely.&nbsp; <i>There</i> is his best dignity,
and therefore his best beauty.&nbsp; For even beauty is not to be thrust
upon us; she is not to solicit us or offer herself thus to the first
comer; and in the most admired of those flying lyrics she is thus immoderately
lavish of herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He lays himself out,&rdquo; wrote Francis
Thompson in an anonymous criticism, &ldquo;to delight and seduce.&nbsp;
The great poets entice by a glorious accident . . . but allurement,
in Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s poetry, is the alpha and omega.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is true of all that he has written, but it is true, in a more fatal
sense, of these famous tunes of his &ldquo;music.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay,
delicate as they are, we are convinced that it is the less delicate
ear that most surely takes much pleasure in them, the dull ear that
chiefly they delight.</p>
<p>Compare with such luxurious canterings the graver movement of this
&ldquo;Vision of Spring in Winter&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sunrise it sees not, neither set of star,<br />
Large nightfall, nor imperial plenilune,<br />
Nor strong sweet shape of the full-breasted noon;<br />
But where the silver-sandalled shadows are,<br />
Too soft for arrows of the sun to mar,<br />
Moves with the mild gait of an ungrown moon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even more valuable than this exquisite rhymed stanza is the blank
verse which Swinburne released into new energies, new liberties, and
new movements.&nbsp; Milton, it need hardly be said, is the master of
those who know how to place and displace the stress and accent of the
English heroic line in epic poetry.&nbsp; His most majestic hand undid
the mechanical bonds of the national line and made it obey the unwritten
laws of his genius.&nbsp; His blank verse marches, pauses, lingers,
and charges.&nbsp; It feels the strain, it yields, it resists; it is
all-expressive.&nbsp; But if the practice of some of the poets succeeding
him had tended to make it rigid and tame again, Swinburne was a new
liberator.&nbsp; He writes, when he ought, with a finely appropriate
regularity, as in the lovely line on the forest glades</p>
<blockquote><p>That fear the faun&rsquo;s and know the dryad&rsquo;s
foot,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in which the rule is completely kept, every step of the five stepping
from the unaccented place to the accented without a tremor.&nbsp; (I
must again protest that I use the word &ldquo;accent&rdquo; in a sense
that has come to be adapted to English prosody, because it is so used
by all writers on English metre, and is therefore understood by the
reader, but I think &ldquo;stress&rdquo; the better word.)&nbsp; But
having written this perfect English-iambic line so wonderfully fit for
the sensitive quiet of the woods, he turns the page to the onslaught
of such lines&mdash;heroic lines with a difference&mdash;as report the
short-breathed messenger&rsquo;s reply to Althea&rsquo;s question by
whose hands the boar of Calydon had died:</p>
<blockquote><p>A maiden&rsquo;s and a prophet&rsquo;s and thy son&rsquo;s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is lamentable that in his latest blank verse Swinburne should
have made a trick and a manner of that most energetic device of his
by which he leads the line at a rush from the first syllable to the
tenth, and on to the first of the line succeeding, with a great recoil
to follow, as though a rider brought a horse to his haunches.&nbsp;
It is in the same boar hunt:</p>
<blockquote><p>And fiery with invasive eyes,<br />
And bristling with intolerable hair,<br />
Plunged;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we may be troubled with a misgiving that Swinburne&rsquo;s
fine narrative, as well as his descriptive writing of other kinds, has
a counterpart in the programme-music of some now bygone composers.&nbsp;
It is even too descriptive, too imitative of things, and seems to out-run
the province of words, somewhat as that did the province of notes.&nbsp;
But, though this hunting, and checking, and floating, and flying in
metre may be to strain the arts of prosody and diction, with how masterly
a hand is the straining accomplished!&nbsp; The spear, the arrow, the
attack, the charge, the footfall, the pinion, nay, the very stepping
of the moon, the walk of the wind, are mimicked in this enchanting verse.&nbsp;
Like to programme-music we must call it, but I wish the concert-platform
had ever justified this slight perversion of aim, this excess&mdash;almost
corruption&mdash;of one kind of skill, thus miraculously well.</p>
<p>Now, if Swinburne&rsquo;s exceptional faculty of diction led him
to immoderate expressiveness, to immodest sweetness, to a jugglery,
and prestidigitation, and conjuring of words, to transformations and
transmutations of sound&mdash;if, I say, his extraordinary gift of diction
brought him to this exaggeration of the manner, what a part does it
not play in the matter of his poetry!&nbsp; So overweening a place does
it take in this man&rsquo;s art that I believe the words to hold and
use his meaning, rather than the meaning to compass and grasp and use
the word.&nbsp; I believe that Swinburne&rsquo;s thoughts have their
source, their home, their origin, their authority and mission in those
two places&mdash;his own vocabulary and the passion of other men.&nbsp;
This is a grave charge.</p>
<p>First, then, in regard to the passion of other men.&nbsp; I have
given to his own emotion the puniest name I could find for it; I have
no nobler name for his intellect.&nbsp; But other men had thoughts,
other men had passions; political, sexual, natural, noble, vile, ideal,
gross, rebellious, agonising, imperial, republican, cruel, compassionate;
and with these he fed his verses.&nbsp; Upon these and their life he
sustained, he fattened, he enriched his poetry.&nbsp; Mazzini in Italy,
Gautier and Baudelaire in France, Shelley in England, made for him a
base of passionate and intellectual supplies.&nbsp; With them he kept
the all-necessary line of communication.&nbsp; We cease, as we see their
active hearts possess his active art, to think a question as to his
sincerity seriously worth asking; what sincerity he has is so absorbed
in the one excited act of receptivity.&nbsp; That, indeed, he performs
with all the will, all the precipitation, all the rush, all the surrender,
all the wholehearted weakness of his subservient and impetuous nature.&nbsp;
I have not named the Greeks, nor the English Bible, nor Milton, as his
inspirers.&nbsp; These he would claim; they are not his.&nbsp; He received
too partial, too fragmentary, too arbitrary an inheritance of the Greek
spirit, too illusory an idea of Milton, of the English Bible little
more than a tone;&mdash;this poet of eager, open capacity, this poet
who is little more, intellectually, than a too-ready, too-vacant capacity,
for those three august seventies has not room enough.</p>
<p>Charged, then, with other men&rsquo;s purposes&mdash;this man&rsquo;s
Italian patriotism; this man&rsquo;s love of sin (by that name, for
sin has been denied, as a fiction, but Swinburne, following Baudelaire,
acknowledges it to love it); this man&rsquo;s despite against the Third
Empire or what not; this man&rsquo;s cry for a political liberty granted
or gained long ago&mdash;a cry grown vain; this man&rsquo;s contempt
for the Boers&mdash;nay, was it so much as a man, with a man&rsquo;s
evil to answer for, that furnished him here; was it not rather that
less guilty judge, the crowd?&mdash;this man&rsquo;s&mdash;nay, this
boy&rsquo;s&mdash;erotic sickness, or his cruelty&mdash;charged with
all these, Swinburne&rsquo;s poetry is primed; it explodes with thunder
and fire.&nbsp; But such sharing is somewhat too familiar for dignity;
such community of goods parodies the Franciscans.&nbsp; As one friar
goes darned for another&rsquo;s rending, having no property in cassock
or cowl, so does many a poet, not in humility, but in a paradox of pride,
boast of the past of others.&nbsp; And yet one might rather choose to
make use of one&rsquo;s fellow-men&rsquo;s old shoes than to put their
old secrets to usufruct, and dress poetry in a motley of shed passions,
twice corrupt.&nbsp; Promiscuity of love we have heard of; Pope was
accused, by Lord Hervey&rsquo;s indignation and wit, of promiscuity
of hatred, and of scattering his disfavours in the stews of an indiscriminate
malignity; and here is another promiscuity&mdash;that of memories, and
of a licence partaken.</p>
<p>But by the unanimous poets&rsquo; splendid love of the landscape
and the skies, by this also was Swinburne possessed, and in this he
triumphed.&nbsp; By this, indeed, he profited; here he joined an innumerable
company of that heavenly host of earth.&nbsp; Let us acknowledge then
his honourable alacrity here, his quick fellowship, his agile adoption,
and his filial tenderness&mdash;nay, his fraternal union with his poets.&nbsp;
No tourist&rsquo;s admiration for all things French, no tourist&rsquo;s
politics in Italy&mdash;and Swinburne&rsquo;s French and Italian admirations
have the tourist manner of enthusiasm&mdash;prompts him here.&nbsp;
Here he aspires to brotherhood with the supreme poets of supreme England,
with the sixteenth century, the seventeenth, and the nineteenth, the
impassioned centuries of song.&nbsp; Happy is he to be admitted among
these, happy is he to merit by his wonderful voice to sing their raptures.&nbsp;
Here is no humiliation in ready-made lendings; their ecstasy becomes
him.&nbsp; He is glorious with them, and we can imagine this benign
and indulgent Nature confounding together the sons she embraces, and
making her poets&mdash;the primary and the secondary, the greater and
the lesser&mdash;all equals in her arms.&nbsp; Let us see him in that
company where he looks noble amongst the noble; let us not look upon
him in the company of the ignoble, where he looks ignobler still, being
servile to them; let us look upon him with the lyrical Shakespeare,
with Vaughan, Blake, Wordsworth, Patmore, Meredith; not with Baudelaire
and Gautier; with the poets of the forest and the sun, and not with
those of the alcove.&nbsp; We can make peace with him for love of them;
we can imagine them thankful to him who, poor and perverse in thought
in so many pages, could yet join them in such a song as this:</p>
<blockquote><p>And her heart sprang in Iseult, and she drew<br />
With all her spirit and life the sunrise through,<br />
And through her lips the keen triumphant air<br />
Sea-scented, sweeter than land-roses were,<br />
And through her eyes the whole rejoicing east<br />
Sun-satisfied, and all the heaven at feast<br />
Spread for the morning; and the imperious mirth<br />
Of wind and light that moved upon the earth,<br />
Making the spring, and all the fruitful might<br />
And strong regeneration of delight<br />
That swells the seedling leaf and sapling man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He, nevertheless, who was able, in high company, to hail the sea
with such fine verse, was not ashamed, in low company, to sing the famous
absurdities about &ldquo;the lilies and languors of virtue and the roses
and raptures of vice,&rdquo; with many and many a passage of like character.&nbsp;
I think it more generous, seeing I have differed so much from the Nineteenth
Century&rsquo;s chorus of excessive praise, to quote little from the
vacant, the paltry, the silly&mdash;no word is so fit as that last little
word&mdash;among his pages.&nbsp; Therefore, I have justified my praise,
but not my blame.&nbsp; It is for the reader to turn to the justifying
pages: to &ldquo;A Song of Italy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Les Noyades,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hermaphroditus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Satia te Sanguine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kissing
her Hair,&rdquo; &ldquo;An Interlude,&rdquo; &ldquo;In a Garden,&rdquo;
or such a stanza as the one beginning</p>
<blockquote><p>O thought illimitable and infinite heart<br />
Whose blood is life in limbs indissolute<br />
That all keep heartless thine invisible part<br />
And inextirpable thy viewless root<br />
Whence all sweet shafts of green and each thy dart<br />
Of sharpening leaf and bud resundering shoot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is for the reader who has preserved rectitude of intellect, sincerity
of heart, dignity of nerves, unhurried thoughts, an unexcited heart,
and an ardour for poetry, to judge between such poems and an authentic
passion, between such poems and truth, I will add between such poems
and beauty.</p>
<p>Imagery is a great part of poetry; but out, alas! vocabulary has
here too the upper hand.&nbsp; For in what is still sometimes called
the magnificent chorus in &ldquo;Atalanta&rdquo; the words have swallowed
not the thought only but the imagery.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s grievance
is that the pleasant streams flow into the sea.&nbsp; What would he
have?&nbsp; The streams turned loose all over the unfortunate country?&nbsp;
There is, it is true, the river Mole in Surrey.&nbsp; But I am not sure
that some foolish imagery against the peace of the burrowing river might
not be due from a poet of facility.&nbsp; I am not censuring any insincerity
of thought; I am complaining of the insincerity of a paltry, shaky,
and unvisionary image.</p>
<p>Having had recourse to the passion of stronger minds for his provision
of emotions, Swinburne had direct recourse to his own vocabulary as
a kind of &ldquo;safe&rdquo; wherein he stored what he needed for a
song.&nbsp; Claudius stole the precious diadem of the kingdom from a
shelf and put it in his pocket; Swinburne took from the shelf of literature&mdash;took
with what art, what touch, what cunning, what complete skill!&mdash;the
treasure of the language, and put it in his pocket.</p>
<p>He is urgent with his booty of words, for he has no other treasure.&nbsp;
Into his pocket he thrusts a hand groping for hatred, and draws forth
&ldquo;blood&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hell&rdquo;&mdash;generally &ldquo;Hell,&rdquo;
for I have counted many &ldquo;Hells&rdquo; in a quite short poem.&nbsp;
In search of wrath he takes hold of &ldquo;fire&rdquo;; anxious for
wildness he takes &ldquo;foam,&rdquo; for sweetness he brings out &ldquo;flower,&rdquo;
much linked, so that &ldquo;flower-soft&rdquo; has almost become his,
and not Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For in that compound he labours to
exaggerate Shakespeare, and by his insistence and iteration goes about
to spoil for us the &ldquo;flower-soft hands&rdquo; of Cleopatra&rsquo;s
rudder-maiden; but he shall not spoil Shakespeare&rsquo;s phrase for
us.&nbsp; And behold, in all this fundamental fumbling Swinburne&rsquo;s
critics saw only a &ldquo;mannerism,&rdquo; if they saw even thus much
offence.</p>
<p>One of the chief pocket-words was &ldquo;Liberty.&rdquo;&nbsp; O
Liberty! what verse is committed in thy name!&nbsp; Or, to cite Madame
Roland more accurately, O Liberty, how have they &ldquo;run&rdquo; thee!</p>
<p>Who, it has been well asked by a citizen of a modern free country,
is thoroughly free except a fish?&nbsp; <i>Et</i> <i>encore&mdash;</i>even
the &ldquo;silent and footless herds&rdquo; may have more inter-accommodation
than we are aware.&nbsp; But in the pocket of the secondary poet how
easy and how ready a word is this, a word implying old and true heroisms,
but significant here of an excitable poet&rsquo;s economies.&nbsp; Yes,
economies of thought and passion.&nbsp; This poet, who is conspicuously
the poet of excess, is in deeper truth the poet of penury and defect.</p>
<p>And here is a pocket-word which might have astonished us had we not
known how little anyway it signified.&nbsp; It occurs in something customary
about Italy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hearest thou,<br />
Italia?&nbsp; Tho&rsquo; deaf sloth hath sealed thine ears,<br />
The world has heard thy children&mdash;and God hears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was ever thought so pouched, so produced, so surely a handful of
loot, as the last thought of this verse?</p>
<p>What, finally, is his influence upon the language he has ransacked?&nbsp;
A temporary laying-waste, undoubtedly.&nbsp; That is, the contemporary
use of his vocabulary is spoilt, his beautiful words are wasted, spent,
squandered, <i>gaspill&eacute;s</i>.&nbsp; The contemporary use&mdash;I
will not say the future use, for no critic should prophesy.&nbsp; But
the past he has not been able to violate.&nbsp; He has had no power
to rob of their freshness the sixteenth-century flower, the seventeenth-century
fruit, or by his violence to shake from either a drop of their dews.</p>
<p>At the outset I warned the judges and the pronouncers of sentences
how this poet, with other poets of quite different character, would
escape their summaries, and he has indeed refuted that maxim which I
had learned at illustrious knees, &ldquo;You may not dissociate the
matter and manner of any of the greatest poets; the two are so fused
by integrity of fire, whether in tragedy or epic or in the simplest
song, that the sundering is the vainest task of criticism.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But I cannot read Swinburne and not be compelled to divide his secondhand
and enfeebled and excited matter from the successful art of his word.&nbsp;
Of that word Francis Thompson has said again, &ldquo;It imposes a law
on the sense.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore, he too perceived that fatal division.&nbsp;
Is, then, the wisdom of the maxim confounded?&nbsp; Or is Swinburne&rsquo;s
a &ldquo;single and excepted case&rdquo;?&nbsp; Excepted by a thousand
degrees of talent from any generality fitting the obviously lesser poets,
but, possibly, also excepted by an essential inferiority from this great
maxim fitting only the greatest?</p>
<h2>CHARLOTTE AND EMILY BRONT&Euml;</h2>
<p>The controversy here is with those who admire Charlotte Bront&euml;
throughout her career.&nbsp; She altered greatly.&nbsp; She did, in
fact, inherit a manner of English that had been strained beyond restoration,
fatigued beyond recovery, by the &ldquo;corrupt following&rdquo; of
Gibbon; and there was within her a sense of propriety that caused her
to conform.&nbsp; Straitened and serious elder daughter of her time,
she kept the house of literature.&nbsp; She practised those verbs, to
evince, to reside, to intimate, to peruse.&nbsp; She wrote &ldquo;communicating
instruction&rdquo; for teaching; &ldquo;an extensive and eligible connexion&rdquo;;
&ldquo;a small competency&rdquo;; &ldquo;an establishment on the Continent&rdquo;;
&ldquo;It operated as a barrier to further intercourse&rdquo;; and of
a child (with a singular unfitness with childhood) &ldquo;For the toys
he possesses he seems to have contracted a partiality amounting to affection.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I have been already reproached for a word on Gibbon written by way of
parenthesis in the course of an appreciation of some other author.&nbsp;
Let me, therefore, repeat that I am writing of the corrupt following
of that apostle and not of his own style.&nbsp; Gibbon&rsquo;s grammar
is frequently weak, but the corrupt followers have something worse than
poor grammar.&nbsp; Gibbon set the fashion of &ldquo;the latter&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the former.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our literature was for at least
half a century strewn with the wreckage of Gibbon.&nbsp; &ldquo;After
suppressing a competitor who had assumed the purple at Mentz, he refused
to gratify his troops with the plunder of the rebellious city,&rdquo;
writes the great historian.&nbsp; When Mr. Micawber confesses &ldquo;gratifying
emotions of no common description&rdquo; he conforms to a lofty and
a distant Gibbon.&nbsp; So does Mr. Pecksniff when he says of the copper-founder&rsquo;s
daughter that she &ldquo;has shed a vision on my path refulgent in its
nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when an author, in a work on &ldquo;The Divine
Comedy,&rdquo; recently told us that Paolo and Francesca were to receive
from Dante &ldquo;such alleviation as circumstances would allow,&rdquo;
that also is a shattered, a waste Gibbon, a waif of Gibbon.&nbsp; For
Johnson less than Gibbon inflated the English our fathers inherited;
because Johnson did not habitually or often use imagery, whereas Gibbon
did use habitual imagery, and such use is what deprives a language of
elasticity, and leaves it either rigid or languid, oftener languid.&nbsp;
Encumbered by this drift and refuse of English, Charlotte Bront&euml;
yet achieved the miracle of her vocabulary.&nbsp; It is less wonderful
that she should have appeared out of such a parsonage than that she
should have arisen out of such a language.</p>
<p>A re-reading of her works is always a new amazing of her reader who
turns back to review the harvest of her English.&nbsp; It must have
been with rapture that she claimed her own simplicity.&nbsp; And with
what a moderation, how temperately, and how seldom she used her mastery!&nbsp;
To the last she has an occasional attachment to her bonds; for she was
not only fire and air.&nbsp; In one passage of her life she may remind
us of the little colourless and thrifty hen-bird that Lowell watched
nest-building with her mate, and cutting short the flutterings and billings
wherewith he would joyously interrupt the business; Charlotte&rsquo;s
nesting bird was a clergyman.&nbsp; He came, lately affianced, for a
week&rsquo;s visit to her parsonage, and she wrote to her friend before
his arrival: &ldquo;My little plans have been disarranged by an intimation
that Mr.&mdash;is coming on Monday&rdquo;; and afterwards, in reference
to her sewing, &ldquo;he hindered me for a full week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In alternate pages <i>Villette</i> is a book of spirit and fire,
and a novel of illiberal rancour, of ungenerous, uneducated anger, ungentle,
ignoble.&nbsp; In order to forgive its offences, we have to remember
in its author&rsquo;s favour not her pure style set free, not her splendour
in literature, but rather the immeasurable sorrow of her life.&nbsp;
To read of that sorrow again is to open once more a wound which most
men perhaps, certainly most women, received into their hearts in childhood.&nbsp;
For the Life of Charlotte Bront&euml; is one of the first books of biography
put into the hands of a child, to whom <i>Jane</i> <i>Eyre</i> is allowed
only in passages.&nbsp; We are young when we first hear in what narrow
beds &ldquo;the three are laid&rdquo;&mdash;the two sisters and the
brother&mdash;and in what a bed of living insufferable memories the
one left lay alone, reviewing the hours of their death&mdash;alone in
the sealed house that was only less narrow than their graves.&nbsp;
The rich may set apart and dedicate a room, the poor change their street,
but Charlotte Bront&euml;, in the close captivity of the fortunes of
mediocrity, rested in the chair that had been her dying sister&rsquo;s,
and held her melancholy bridals in the dining room that had been the
scene of terrible and reluctant death.</p>
<p>But closer than the conscious house was the conscious mind.&nbsp;
Locked with intricate wards within the unrelaxing and unlapsing thoughts
of this lonely sister, dwelt a sorrow inconsolable.&nbsp; It is well
for the perpetual fellowship of mankind that no child should read this
life and not take therefrom a perdurable scar, albeit her heart was
somewhat frigid towards childhood, and she died before her motherhood
could be born.</p>
<p>Mistress of some of the best prose of her century, Charlotte Bront&euml;
was subject to a Lewes, a Chorley, a Miss Martineau: that is, she suffered
what in Italian is called <i>soggezione</i> in their presence.&nbsp;
When she had met six minor contemporary writers&mdash;by-products of
literature&mdash;at dinner, she had a headache and a sleepless night.&nbsp;
She writes to her friend that these contributors to the quarterly press
are greatly feared in literary London, and there is in her letter a
sense of tremor and exhaustion.&nbsp; And what nights did the heads
of the critics undergo after the meeting?&nbsp; Lewes, whose own romances
are all condoned, all forgiven by time and oblivion, who gave her lessons,
who told her to study Jane Austen?&nbsp; The others, whose reviews doubtless
did their proportionate part in still further hunting and harrying the
tired English of their day?&nbsp; And before Harriet Martineau she bore
herself reverently.&nbsp; Harriet Martineau, albeit a woman of masculine
understanding (we may imagine we hear her contemporaries give her the
title), could not thread her way safely in and out of two or three negatives,
but wrote&mdash;about this very Charlotte Bront&euml;: &ldquo;I did
not consider the book a coarse one, though I could not answer for it
that there were no traits which, on a second leisurely reading, I might
not dislike.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell quotes the passage with no consciousness
of anything amiss.</p>
<p>As for Lewes&rsquo;s vanished lesson upon the methods of Jane Austen,
it served one only sufficient purpose.&nbsp; Itself is not quoted by
anyone alive, but Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s rejoinder adds one to
our little treasury of her incomparable pages.&nbsp; If they were twenty,
they are twenty-one by the addition of this, written in a long-neglected
letter and saved for us by Mr. Shorter&rsquo;s research, for I believe
his is the only record: &ldquo;What sees keenly, speaks aptly, moves
flexibly, it suits her to study; but what throbs fast and full, though
hidden, what blood rushes through, what is the unseen seat of life and
the sentient target of death&mdash;that Miss Austen ignores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the author of <i>Jane</i> <i>Eyre</i> faltered before six authors,
more or less, at dinner in London, was it the writer of her second-class
English who was shy? or was it the author of the passages here to follow?&mdash;and
therefore one for whom the national tongue was much the better?&nbsp;
There can be little doubt.&nbsp; The Charlotte Bront&euml; who used
the English of a world long corrupted by &ldquo;one good custom&rdquo;&mdash;the
good custom of Gibbon&rsquo;s Latinity grown fatally popular&mdash;could
at any time hold up her head amongst her reviewers; for her there was
no sensitive interior solitude in that society.&nbsp; She who cowered
was the Charlotte who made Rochester recall &ldquo;the simple yet sagacious
grace&rdquo; of Jane&rsquo;s first smile; she who wrote: &ldquo;I looked
at my love; it shivered in my heart like a suffering child in a cold
cradle&rdquo;; who wrote: &ldquo;To see what a heavy lid day slowly
lifted, what a wan glance she flung upon the hills, you would have thought
the sun&rsquo;s fire quenched in last night&rsquo;s floods.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This new genius was solitary and afraid, and touched to the quick by
the eyes and voice of judges.&nbsp; In her worse style there was no
&ldquo;quick.&rdquo;&nbsp; Latin-English, whether scholarly or unscholarly,
is the mediate tongue.&nbsp; An unscholarly Latin-English is proof against
the world.&nbsp; The scholarly Latin-English wherefrom it is disastrously
derived is, in its own nobler measure, a defence against more august
assaults than those of criticism.&nbsp; In the strength of it did Johnson
hold parley with his profounder sorrows&mdash;hold parley (by his phrase),
make terms (by his definition), give them at last lodging and entertainment
after sentence and treaty.</p>
<p>And the meaner office of protection against reviewers and the world
was doubtless done by the meaner Latinity.&nbsp; The author of the phrase
&ldquo;The child contracted a partiality for his toys&rdquo; had no
need to fear any authors she might meet at dinner.&nbsp; Against Charlotte
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s sorrows her worse manner of English never stands
for a moment.&nbsp; Those vain phrases fall from before her face and
her bared heart.&nbsp; To the heart, to the heart she took the shafts
of her griefs.&nbsp; She tells them therefore as she suffered them,
vitally and mortally.&nbsp; &ldquo;A great change approached.&nbsp;
Affliction came in that shape which to anticipate is dread; to look
back on, grief.&nbsp; My sister Emily first declined.&nbsp; Never in
all her life had she lingered over any task that lay before her, and
she did not linger now.&nbsp; She made haste to leave us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I remembered where the three were laid&mdash;in what narrow,
dark dwellings.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know this place?&nbsp; No,
you never saw it; but you recognize the nature of these trees, this
foliage&mdash;the cypress, the willow, the yew.&nbsp; Stone crosses
like these are not unfamiliar to you, nor are these dim garlands of
everlasting flowers.&nbsp; Here is the place.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
the watcher approaches the patient&rsquo;s pillow, and sees a new and
strange moulding of the familiar features, feels at once that the insufferable
moment draws nigh.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same passage comes another single
word of genius, &ldquo;the sound that so wastes our strength.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And, fine as &ldquo;wastes,&rdquo; is the &ldquo;wronged&rdquo; of another
sentence&mdash;&ldquo;some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is easy to gather such words, more difficult to separate the best
from such a mingled page as that on &ldquo;Imagination&rdquo;: &ldquo;A
spirit, softer and better than human reason, had descended with quiet
flight to the waste&rdquo;; and &ldquo;My hunger has this good angel
appeased with food sweet and strange&rdquo;; and &ldquo;This daughter
of Heaven remembered me to-night; she saw me weep, and she came with
comfort; &lsquo;Sleep,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;sleep sweetly&mdash;I
gild thy dreams.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Was this feeling dead?&nbsp;
I do not know, but it was buried.&nbsp; Sometimes I thought the tomb
unquiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most &ldquo;eloquent&rdquo; pages are unluckily those
wherein we miss the friction&mdash;friction of water to the oar, friction
of air to the pinion&mdash;friction that sensibly proves the use, the
buoyancy, the act of language.&nbsp; Sometimes an easy eloquence resembles
the easy labours of the daughters of Danaus.&nbsp; To draw water in
a sieve is an easy art, rapid and relaxed.</p>
<p>But no laxity is ever, I think, to be found in her brief passages
of landscape.&nbsp; &ldquo;The keen, still cold of the morning was succeeded,
later in the day, by a sharp breathing from the Russian wastes; the
cold zone sighed over the temperate zone and froze it fast.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not till the destroying angel of tempest had achieved his perfect
work would he fold the wings whose waft was thunder, the tremor of whose
plumes was storm.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The night is not calm: the equinox
still struggles in its storms.&nbsp; The wild rains of the day are abated:
the great single cloud disappears and rolls away from Heaven, not passing
and leaving a sea all sapphire, but tossed buoyant before a continued,
long-sounding, high-rushing moonlight tempest. . . No Endymion will
watch for his goddess to-night: there are no flocks on the mountains.&rdquo;&nbsp;
See, too, this ocean: &ldquo;The sway of the whole Great Deep above
a herd of whales rushing through the livid and liquid thunder down from
the frozen zone.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this promise of the visionary Shirley:
&ldquo;I am to be walking by myself on deck, rather late of an August
evening, watching and being watched by a full harvest moon: something
is to rise white on the surface of the sea, over which that moon mounts
silent, and hangs glorious. . . I think I hear it cry with an articulate
voice. . . I show you an image fair as alabaster emerging from the dim
wave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte Bront&euml; knew well the experience of dreams.&nbsp; She
seems to have undergone the inevitable dream of mourners&mdash;the human
dream of the Labyrinth, shall I call it? the uncertain spiritual journey
in search of the waiting and sequestered dead, which is the obscure
subject of the &ldquo;Eurydice&rdquo; of Coventry Patmore&rsquo;s Odes.&nbsp;
There is the lately dead, in exile, remote, betrayed, foreign, indifferent,
sad, forsaken by some vague malice or neglect, sought by troubled love
astray.</p>
<p>In Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s page there is an autumnal and tempestuous
dream.&nbsp; &ldquo;A nameless experience that had the hue, the mien,
the terror, the very tone of a visitation from eternity. . . Suffering
brewed in temporal or calculable measure tastes not as this suffering
tasted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finally, is there any need to cite the passage
of <i>Jane</i> <i>Eyre</i> that contains the avowal, the vigil in the
garden?&nbsp; Those are not words to be forgotten.&nbsp; Some tell you
that a fine style will give you the memory of a scene and not of the
recording words that are the author&rsquo;s means.&nbsp; And others
again would have the phrase to be remembered foremost.&nbsp; Here, then,
in <i>Jane</i> <i>Eyre</i>, are both memories equal.&nbsp; The night
is perceived, the phrase is an experience; both have their place in
the reader&rsquo;s irrevocable past.&nbsp; &ldquo;Custom intervened
between me and what I naturally and inevitably loved.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Jane,
do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A
waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel walk, and trembled through
the boughs of the chestnut; it wandered away to an infinite distance.
. . The nightingale&rsquo;s voice was then the only voice of the hour;
in listening I again wept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Whereas Charlotte Bront&euml; walked, with exultation and enterprise,
upon the road of symbols, under the guidance of her own visiting genius,
Emily seldom went out upon those far avenues.&nbsp; She was one who
practised imagery sparingly.&nbsp; Her style had the key of an inner
prose which seems to leave imagery behind in the way of approaches&mdash;the
apparelled and arrayed approaches and ritual of literature&mdash;and
so to go further and to be admitted among simple realities and antitypes.</p>
<p>Charlotte Bront&euml; also knew that simple goal, but she loved her
imagery.&nbsp; In the passage of <i>Jane</i> <i>Eyre</i> that tells
of the return to Thornfield Hall, in ruins by fire, she bespeaks her
reader&rsquo;s romantic attention to an image which in truth is not
all golden.&nbsp; She has moments, on the other hand, of pure narrative,
whereof each word is such a key as I spoke of but now, and unlocks an
inner and an inner plain door of spiritual realities.&nbsp; There is,
perhaps, no author who, simply telling what happened, tells it with
so great a significance: &ldquo;Jane, did you hear that nightingale
singing in the wood?&rdquo; and &ldquo;She made haste to leave us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But her characteristic calling is to images, those avenues and temples
oracular, and to the vision of symbols.</p>
<p>You may hear the poet of great imagery praised as a great mystic.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, although a great mystical poet makes images, he does not
do so in his greatest moments.&nbsp; He is a great mystic, because he
has a full vision of the mystery of realities, not because he has a
clear invention of similitudes.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of many thousand kisses the poor last,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Now with his love, now in the colde grave</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are lines on the yonder side of imagery.&nbsp; So is this line also:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sad with the promise of a different sun,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Piteous passion keen at having found,<br />
After exceeding ill, a little good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shakespeare, Chaucer and Patmore yield us these great examples.&nbsp;
Imagery is for the time when, as in these lines, the shock of feeling
(which must needs pass, as the heart beats and pauses) is gone by:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thy heart with dead winged innocence filled,<br />
Even as a nest with birds,<br />
After the old ones by the hawk are killed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cite these lines of Patmore&rsquo;s because of their imagery in
a poem that without them would be insupportably close to spiritual facts;
and because it seems to prove with what a yielding hand at play the
poet of realities holds his symbols for a while.&nbsp; A great writer
is both a major and a minor mystic, in the self-same poem; now suddenly
close to his mystery (which is his greater moment) and anon making it
mysterious with imagery (which is the moment of his most beautiful lines).</p>
<p>The student passes delighted through the several courts of poetry,
from the outer to the inner, from riches to more imaginative riches,
and from decoration to more complex decoration; and prepares himself
for the greater opulence of the innermost chamber.&nbsp; But when he
crosses the last threshold he finds this mid-most sanctuary to be a
hypaethral temple, and in its custody and care a simple earth and a
space of sky.</p>
<p>Emily Bront&euml; seems to have a nearly unparalleled unconsciousness
of the delays, the charms, the pauses and preparations of imagery.&nbsp;
Her strength does not dally with the parenthesis, and her simplicity
is ignorant of those rites.&nbsp; Her lesser work, therefore, is plain
narrative, and her greater work is no more.&nbsp; On the hither side&mdash;the
daily side&mdash;of imagery she is still a strong and solitary writer;
on the yonder side she has written some of the most mysterious passages
in all plain prose.&nbsp; And with what direct and incommunicable art!&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me alone, let me alone,&rsquo; said Catherine.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If I&rsquo;ve done wrong, I&rsquo;m dying for it.&nbsp; You left
me too . . . I forgive you.&nbsp; Forgive me!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes and feel those wasted
hands,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Kiss me again, and don&rsquo;t
let me see your eyes!&nbsp; I forgive what you have done to me.&nbsp;
I love my murderer&mdash;but <i>yours</i>!&nbsp; How can I?&rsquo;&nbsp;
They were silent, their faces hid against each other, and washed by
each other&rsquo;s tears.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So much the worse for
me that I am strong,&rdquo; cries Heathcliff in the same scene.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do I want to live?&nbsp; What kind of living will it be when
you&mdash;Oh God, would you like to live with your soul in the grave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s noblest passages are her own speech
or the speech of one like herself acting the central part in the dreams
and dramas of emotion that she had kept from her girlhood&mdash;the
unavowed custom of the ordinary girl by her so splendidly avowed in
a confidence that comprised the world.&nbsp; Emily had no such confessions
to publish.&nbsp; She contrived&mdash;but the word does not befit her
singular spirit of liberty, that knew nothing of stealth&mdash;to remove
herself from the world; as her person left no pen-portrait, so her &ldquo;I&rdquo;
is not heard here.&nbsp; She lends her voice in disguise to her men
and women; the first narrator of her great romance is a young man, the
second a servant woman; this one or that among the actors takes up the
story, and her great words sound at times in paltry mouths.&nbsp; It
is then that for a moment her reader seems about to come into her immediate
presence, but by a fiction she denies herself to him.&nbsp; To a somewhat
trivial girl (or a girl who would be trivial in any other book, but
Emily Bront&euml; seems unable to create anything consistently meagre)&mdash;to
Isabella Linton she commits one of her most memorable passages, and
one which has the rare image, one of a terrifying little company of
visions amid terrifying facts: &ldquo;His attention was roused, I saw,
for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes. . . The clouded windows
of hell flashed for a moment towards me; the fiend which usually looked
out was so dimmed and drowned.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in Heathcliff&rsquo;s
own speech there is no veil or circumstance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
too happy; and yet I&rsquo;m not happy enough.&nbsp; My soul&rsquo;s
bliss kills my body, but does not satisfy itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have to remind myself to breathe, and almost to remind my heart to beat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole
barrier between us, I said to myself: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have her in
my arms again.&rsquo;&nbsp; If she be cold, I&rsquo;ll think it is this
north wind that chills me; and if she be motionless, it is sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What art, moreover, what knowledge, what a fresh ear for the clash of
repetition; what a chime in that phrase: &ldquo;I dreamt I was sleeping
the last sleep by that sleeper, with my heart stopped, and my cheek
frozen against hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emily Bront&euml; was no student of books.&nbsp; It was not from
among the fruits of any other author&rsquo;s labour that she gathered
these eminent words.&nbsp; But I think I have found the suggestion of
this action of Heathcliff&rsquo;s&mdash;the disinterment.&nbsp; Not
in any inspiring ancient Irish legend, as has been suggested, did Emily
Bront&euml; find her incident; she found it (but she made, and did not
find, its beauty) in a mere costume romance of Bulwer Lytton, whom Charlotte
Bront&euml;, as we know, did not admire.&nbsp; And Emily showed no sign
at all of admiration when she did him so much honour as to borrow the
action of his studio-bravo.</p>
<p>Heathcliff&rsquo;s love for Catherine&rsquo;s past childhood is one
of the profound surprises of this unparalleled book; it is to call her
childish ghost&mdash;the ghost of the little girl&mdash;when she has
been a dead adult woman twenty years that the inhuman lover opens the
window of the house on the Heights.&nbsp; Something is this that the
reader knew not how to look for.&nbsp; Another thing known to genius
and beyond a reader&rsquo;s hope is the tempestuous purity of those
passions.&nbsp; This wild quality of purity has a counterpart in the
brief passages of nature that make the summers, the waters, the woods,
and the windy heights of that murderous story seem so sweet.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;beck&rdquo; that was audible beyond the hills after rain, the
&ldquo;heath on the top of Wuthering Heights&rdquo; whereon, in her
dream of Heaven, Catherine, flung out by angry angels, awoke sobbing
for joy; the bird whose feathers she&mdash;delirious creature&mdash;plucks
from the pillow of her deathbed (&ldquo;This&mdash;I should know it
among a thousand&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lapwing&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Bonny bird;
wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor.&nbsp; It wanted to
get to its nest, for the clouds had touched the swells and it felt rain
coming&rdquo;); the only two white spots of snow left on all the moors,
and the brooks brim-full; the old apple-trees, the smell of stocks and
wallflowers in the brief summer, the few fir-trees by Catherine&rsquo;s
window-bars, the early moon&mdash;I know not where are landscapes more
exquisite and natural.&nbsp; And among the signs of death where is any
fresher than the window seen from the garden to be swinging open in
the morning, when Heathcliff lay within, dead and drenched with rain?</p>
<p>None of these things are presented by images.&nbsp; Nor is that signal
passage wherewith the book comes to a close.&nbsp; Be it permitted to
cite it here again.&nbsp; It has taken its place, it is among the paragons
of our literature.&nbsp; Our language will not lapse or derogate while
this prose stands for appeal: &ldquo;I lingered . . . under that benign
sky; watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened
to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how anyone
could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, of Emily Bront&euml;&rsquo;s face the world holds only an
obviously unskilled reflection, and of her aspect no record worth having.&nbsp;
Wild fugitive, she vanished, she escaped, she broke away, exiled by
the neglect of her contemporaries, banished by their disrespect outlawed
by their contempt, dismissed by their indifference.&nbsp; And such an
one was she as might rather have pronounced upon these the sentence
passed by Coriolanus under sentence of expulsion; she might have driven
the world from before her face and cast it out from her presence as
he condemned his Romans: &ldquo;<i>I</i> banish you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHARMIAN</h2>
<p>&ldquo;She is not Cleopatra, but she is at least Charmian,&rdquo;
wrote Keats, conscious that his damsel was not in the vanward of the
pageant of ladies.&nbsp; One may divine that he counted the ways wherein
she was not Cleopatra, the touches whereby she fell short of and differed
from, nay, in which she mimicked, the Queen.</p>
<p>In like manner many of us have for some years past boasted of our
appreciation of the inferior beauty, the substitute, the waiting gentlewoman
of corrupt or corruptible heart; Keats confessed, but did not boast.&nbsp;
It is a vaunt now, an emulation, who shall discover her beauty, who
shall discern her.</p>
<p>She is most conspicuous in the atmosphere in smoke &ldquo;effects,&rdquo;
in the &ldquo;lurid,&rdquo; the &ldquo;mystery&rdquo;; such are the
perfervid words.&nbsp; But let us take the natural and authentic light
as our symbol of Cleopatra, her sprightly port, her infinite jest, her
bluest vein, her variety, her laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Eastern star!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men in cities look upward not much more than animals, and these&mdash;except
the dog when he bays the moon&mdash;look skyward not at all.&nbsp; The
events of the sky do not come and go for the citizens, do not visibly
approach and withdraw, threaten and pardon; they merely happen.&nbsp;
And even when the sun so condescends as to face them at the level of
their own horizon (say from the western end of the Bayswater Road),
when he searches out the eyes that have neglected him all day, finds
a way between their narrowing lids, looks straight into their unwelcoming
pupils, explores the careful wrinkles, singles and numbers the dull
hairs, even, I say, to sudden sunset in our dim climate, the Londoner
makes no reply; he would rather look into puddles than into the pools
of light among clouds.</p>
<p>Yet the light is as characteristic of a country as is its landscape.&nbsp;
So that I would travel for the sake of a character of early morning,
for a quality of noonday, or a tone of afternoon, or an accident of
moonrise, or a colour of dusk, at least as far as for a mountain, a
cathedral, rivers, or men.&nbsp; The light is more important than what
it illuminates.&nbsp; When Mr. Tomkins&mdash;a person of Dickens&rsquo;s
earliest invention&mdash;calls his fellow-boarders from the breakfast-table
to the window, and with emotion shows them the effect of sunshine upon
the left side of a neighbouring chimney-pot, he is far from cutting
the grotesque figure that the humourist intended to point out to banter.&nbsp;
I am not sure that the chimney-pot with the pure light upon it was not
more beautiful than a whole black Greek or a whole black Gothic building
in the adulterated light of a customary London day.&nbsp; Nor is the
pleasure that many writers, and a certain number of painters, tell us
they owe to such adulteration anything other than a sign of derogation&mdash;in
a word, a pleasure in the secondary thing.</p>
<p>Are we the better artists for our preference of the waiting-woman?&nbsp;
It is a strange claim.&nbsp; The search for the beauty of the less-beautiful
is a modern enterprise, ingenious in its minor pranks, insolent in its
greater.&nbsp; And its chief ignobility is the love of marred, defiled,
disordered, dulled, and imperfect skies, the skies of cities.</p>
<p>Some will tell us that the unveiled light is too clear or sharp for
art.&nbsp; So much the worse for art; but even on that plea the limitations
of art are better respected by natural mist, cloudy gloom of natural
rain, natural twilight before night, or natural twilight&mdash;Corot&rsquo;s&mdash;before
day, than by the artificial dimness of our unlovely towns.&nbsp; Those,
too, who praise the &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; of smoke are praising rather
a mystification than a mystery; and must be unaware of the profounder
mysteries of light.&nbsp; Light is all mystery when you face the sun,
and every particle of the innumerable atmosphere carries its infinitesimal
shadow.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is only in some parts of the world that we should ask
for even natural veils.&nbsp; In California we may, not because the
light is too luminous, but because it is not tender.&nbsp; Clear and
not tender in California, tender and not clear in England; light in
Italy and in Greece is both tender and clear.</p>
<p>When one complains of the ill-luck of modern utilities, the sympathetic
listener is apt to agree, but to agree wrongly by denouncing the electric
light as something modern to be deplored.&nbsp; But the electric light
is the one success of the last century.&nbsp; It is never out of harmony
with natural things&mdash;villages, ancient streets of cities, where
it makes the most beautiful of all street-lighting, swung from house
to opposite house in Genoa or Rome.&nbsp; With no shock, except a shock
of pleasure, does the judicious traveller, entering some small sub-alpine
hamlet, find the electric light, fairly, sparingly spaced, slung from
tree to tree over the little road, and note it again in the frugal wine-shop,
and solitary and clear over the church portal.</p>
<p>Yet, forsooth, if yielding to the suggestions of your restless hobby,
you denounce, in any company, the spoiling of your Italy, the hearer,
calling up a &ldquo;mumping visnomy,&rdquo; thinks he echoes your complaint
by his sigh, &ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;the electric light; you meet it everywhere
now; so modern, so disenchanting.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is, on the contrary,
enchanting.&nbsp; It is as natural as lightning.&nbsp; By all means
let all the waterfalls in all the Alps be &ldquo;harnessed,&rdquo; as
the lamentation runs, if their servitude gives us electric light.&nbsp;
For thus the power of the waterfall kindles a lovely lamp.&nbsp; All
this to be done by the simple force of gravitation&mdash;the powerful
fall of water.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wonderful, all that water coming down!&rdquo;
cried the tourist at Niagara, and the Irishman said, &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; He recognised the simplicity of that power.&nbsp; It
is a second-rate passion&mdash;that for the waterfall, and often exacting
in regard to visitors from town.&nbsp; &ldquo;I trudged unwillingly,&rdquo;
says Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;and was not sorry to find it dry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was very, very second-rate of an American admirer of scenery to name
a waterfall in the Yosemite Valley (and it bears the name to-day) the
&ldquo;Bridal Veil.&rdquo;&nbsp; His Indian predecessor had called it,
because it was most audible in menacing weather, &ldquo;The Voice of
the Evil Wind.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, your cascade is dearer to every
sentimentalist than the sky.&nbsp; Standing near the folding-over place
of Niagara, at the top of the fall, I looked across the perpetual rainbow
of the foam, and saw the whole further sky deflowered by the formless,
edgeless, languid, abhorrent murk of smoke from the nearest town.&nbsp;
Much rather would I see that water put to use than the sky so outraged.&nbsp;
As it is, only by picking one&rsquo;s way between cities can one walk
under, or as it were in, a pure sky.&nbsp; The horizon in Venice is
thick and ochreous, and no one cares; the sky of Milan is defiled all
round.&nbsp; In England I must choose a path alertly; and so does now
and then a wary, fortunate, fastidious wind that has so found his exact,
uncharted way, between this smoke and that, as to clear me a clean moonrise,
and heavenly heavens.</p>
<p>There was an ominous prophecy to Charmian.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall
outlive the lady whom you serve.&rdquo;&nbsp; She has outlived her in
every city in Europe; but only for the time of setting straight her
crown&mdash;the last servility.&nbsp; She could not live but by comparison
with the Queen.</p>
<h2>THE CENTURY OF MODERATION</h2>
<p>After a long literary revolt&mdash;one of the recurrences of imperishable
Romance&mdash;against the eighteenth-century authors, a reaction was
due, and it has come about roundly.&nbsp; We are guided back to admiration
of the measure and moderation and shapeliness of the Augustan age.&nbsp;
And indeed it is well enough that we should compare&mdash;not necessarily
check&mdash;some of our habits of thought and verse by the mediocrity
of thought and perfect propriety of diction of Pope&rsquo;s best contemporaries.&nbsp;
If this were all!&nbsp; But the eighteenth century was not content with
its sure and certain genius.&nbsp; Suddenly and repeatedly it aspired
to a &ldquo;noble rage.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not to the wild light hearts
of the seventeenth century that we must look for extreme conceits and
for extravagance, but to the later age, to the faultless, to the frigid,
dissatisfied with their own propriety.&nbsp; There were straws, I confess,
in the hair of the older poets; the eighteenth-century men stuck straws
in their periwigs.</p>
<p>That time&mdash;surpassing and correcting the century then just past
in &ldquo;taste&rdquo;&mdash;was resolved to make a low leg to no age,
antique or modern, in the chapter of the passions&mdash;nay, to show
the way, to fire the nations.&nbsp; Addison taught himself, as his hero
&ldquo;taught the doubtful battle,&rdquo; &ldquo;where to rage.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And in the later years of the same literary century Johnson himself
summoned the lapsed and alien and reluctant fury.&nbsp; Take such a
word as &ldquo;madded&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the madded land&rdquo;; there
indeed is a word created for the noble rage, as the eighteenth century
understood it.&nbsp; Look you, Johnson himself could lodge the fury
in his responsible breast:</p>
<blockquote><p>And dubious title shakes the madded land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no author of that time of moderation and good sense who
does not thus more or less eat a crocodile.&nbsp; It is not necessary
to go to the bad poets; we need go no lower than the good.</p>
<blockquote><p>And gasping Furies thirst for blood in vain,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>says Pope seriously (but the sense of burlesque never leaves the
reader).&nbsp; Also</p>
<blockquote><p>There purple vengeance bath&rsquo;d in gore retires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the only passage of the <i>Dunciad</i> meant to be poetic and
not ironic and spiteful, he has &ldquo;the panting gales&rdquo; of a
garden he describes.&nbsp; Match me such an absurdity among the &ldquo;conceits&rdquo;
of the age preceding!</p>
<p>A noble and ingenious author, so called by high authority but left
anonymous, pretends (it is always pretending with these people, never
fine fiction or a frank lie) that on the tomb of Virgil he had had a
vision of that deceased poet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crowned with eternal bays my ravished eyes<br />
Beheld the poet&rsquo;s awful form arise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virgil tells the noble and ingenious one that if Pope will but write
upon some graver themes,</p>
<blockquote><p>Envy to black Cocytus shall retire<br />
And howl with furies in tormenting fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Genius,&rdquo; says another authoritative writer in prose,
&ldquo;is caused by a furious joy and pride of soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If, leaving the great names, we pass in review the worse poets we
find, in Pope&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;On the Art of Sinking in Poetry,&rdquo;
things like these, gathered from the grave writings of his contemporaries:</p>
<blockquote><p>In flaming heaps the raging ocean rolls,<br />
Whose livid waves involve despairing souls;<br />
The liquid burnings dreadful colours shew,<br />
Some deeply red, and others faintly blue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a war-horse!</p>
<blockquote><p>His eye-balls burn, he wounds the smoking plain,<br />
And knots of scarlet ribbon deck his mane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a demon!</p>
<blockquote><p>Provoking demons all restraint remove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is more eighteenth-century &ldquo;propriety&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>The hills forget they&rsquo;re fixed, and in their fright<br />
Cast off their weight, and ease themselves for flight.<br />
The woods, with terror winged, out-fly the wind,<br />
And leave the heavy, panting hills behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, from Nat Lee&rsquo;s <i>Alexander</i> <i>the</i> <i>Great</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Glory, like the dazzling eagle, stood<br />
Perched on my beaver in the Granic flood;<br />
When Fortune&rsquo;s self my standard trembling bore,<br />
And the pale Fates stood &rsquo;frighted on the shore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of these lines, with another couplet, Dr. Warburton said that they
&ldquo;contain not only the most sublime but the most judicious imagery
that poetry could conceive or paint.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here are lines
from a tragedy, for me anonymous:</p>
<blockquote><p>Should the fierce North, upon his frozen wings,<br />
Bear him aloft above the wondering clouds,<br />
And seat him in the Pleiads&rsquo; golden chariot,<br />
Thence should my fury drag him down to tortures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kiss, while I watch thy swimming eye-balls roll,<br />
Watch thy last gasp, and catch thy springing soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the age of common-sense, we are told, and truly; but of common-sense
now and then dissatisfied, common-sense here and there ambitious, common-sense
of a distinctively adult kind taking on an innocent tone.&nbsp; I find
this little affectation in Pope&rsquo;s word &ldquo;sky&rdquo; where
a simpler poet would have &ldquo;skies&rdquo; or &ldquo;heavens.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pope has &ldquo;sky&rdquo; more than once, and always with a little
false air of simplicity.&nbsp; And one instance occurs in that masterly
and most beautiful poem, the &ldquo;Elegy on an Unfortunate Lady&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there no bright reversion in the sky?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my boy, we may hope so,&rdquo; is the reader&rsquo;s
implicit mental aside, if the reader be a man of humour.&nbsp; Let me,
however, suggest no disrespect towards this lovely elegy, of which the
last eight lines have an inimitable greatness, a tenderness and passion
which the &ldquo;Epistle of Eloisa&rdquo; makes convulsive movements
to attain but never attains.&nbsp; And yet how could one, by an example,
place the splendid seventeenth century in closer&mdash;in slighter yet
more significant&mdash;comparison with the eighteenth than thus?&nbsp;
Here is Ben Jonson:</p>
<blockquote><p>What beckoning ghost, besprent with April dew,<br />
Hails me so solemnly to yonder yew?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is Pope&rsquo;s improvement:</p>
<blockquote><p>What beckoning ghost along the moonlight shade<br />
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Pope follows this insipid couplet with two lines as exquisitely
and nobly modulated as anything I know in that national metre:</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis she! but why that bleeding bosom gored,<br />
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That indeed is &ldquo;music&rdquo; in English verse&mdash;the counterpart
of a great melody, not of a tune.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century matched its desire for wildness in poetry
with a like craving in gardens.&nbsp; The symmetrical and architectural
garden, so magnificent in Italy, and stately though more rigid and less
glorious in France, was scorned by the eighteenth-century poet-gardeners.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Because it was &ldquo;artificial,&rdquo; and the eighteenth
century must have &ldquo;nature&rdquo;&mdash;nay passion.&nbsp; There
seems to be some plan of passion in Pope&rsquo;s grotto, stuck with
spar and little shells.</p>
<p>Truly the age of the &ldquo;Rape of the Lock&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Elegy&rdquo;
was an age of great wit and great poetry.&nbsp; Yet it was untrue to
itself.&nbsp; I think no other century has cherished so persistent a
self-conscious incongruity.&nbsp; As the century of good sense and good
couplets it might have kept uncompromised the dignity we honour.&nbsp;
But such inappropriate pranks have come to pass in history now and again.&nbsp;
The Bishop of Hereford, in merry Barnsdale, &ldquo;danced in his boots&rdquo;;
but he was coerced by Robin Hood.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
